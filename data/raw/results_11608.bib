	abstract = {This paper presents an overview of the regulatory framework for wind energy in European Union Member States. The analysis covers three main aspects of regulatory framework: support schemes, electrical grid issues and potential barriers for wind power deployment. The aim is not just to provide an updated picture of current (early-2015) regulatory framework, but also to analyse the past evolution and trends (in order to achieve the targets of renewable energy share set for 2020). Each country implements a specific regulatory framework driven by several factors: their own renewable energy targets, local availability of renewable resources, energy mix structure, existing infrastructures as well as other factors such as public perception or geographical distribution of electricity generation and consumption points. The results presented in this paper show a trend for increasing the market exposure of wind generators; feed in premiums and competitive bidding procedures to establish the support level are gaining prominence in the last few years. In relation to grid issues, it is a common practice that new wind generators only bear the grid extension costs to the closest connection point; priority or guaranteed access is granted in most Member States and wind generators are usually not demanded to meet balancing requirements (this is expected to change in the next few years following the new guidelines provided by the European Commission). The analysis of potential barriers for wind energy deployment shows that the stability of regulatory framework is one of the most important concerns for investors. Finally, actual deployment over the last few years has been linked with evolution of regulatory frameworks. This analysis shows that some Member States have shown a strong commitment supporting wind energy; however, in other countries the support has not been enough to stimulate the desired level of investment (C) 2015 The Authors.

Wind energy is a clean, eco-friendly, renewable resource having better spread across the country compared to most of the conventional energy sources. This review covers recent developments in the field of wind energy in the country and highlights progress in the areas of wind installation, production, and consumption actively supported by policy formulations, design, and implementation of incentive schemes, and monitoring the effective implementation of the policy frameworks. Further, this paper reviews existing drivers and bottlenecks and identifies future drivers of wind growth in India. It is found that financing of wind projects remains as one of the most important challenges, and the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy is constantly trying to overcome the same. It is anticipated that future wind power developments will be largely driven by the formation of Renewable Energy Act, successful implementation of Offshore Wind Energy Policy, and low-cost financing. © 2016, Springer International Publishing AG.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we address the challenge of Germany's energy transition (Energiewende) as the centrepiece of the country's green industrial policy. In addition to contributing to global climate change objectives, the Energiewende is intended to create a leading position for German industry in renewable energy technologies, boost innovative capabilities and create employment opportunities in future growth markets at the least possible cost. The success in reaching these aims, and indeed the future of the entire concept, is hotly debated. The paper aims to provide an up-to-date assessment of what has become a fierce controversy by comparing solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind energy along five policy objectives: (1) competitiveness, (2) innovation, (3) job creation, (4) climate change mitigation, and (5) cost. We find mixed evidence that Germany reaches its green industrial policy aims at reasonable costs. Wind energy seems to perform better against all policy objectives, while the solar PV sector has come under intense pressure from international competition. However, this is only a snapshot of current performance, and the long term and systemic perspective required for the energy sector transformation suggests a need for a balanced mix of a variety of clean energy sources.

	abstract = {Renewables portfolio standards (RPS) have become an increasingly popular option for encouraging the deployment of renewable electricity. It is a relatively new policy mechanism, however, and experience with its use is only beginning to emerge. One key concern is whether RPS policies offer adequate support to a wide range of renewable energy technologies and applications or whether, alternatively, they will favor a small number of the currently least-cost forms of renewable energy. This article documents the design of and early experience with state-level RPS programs in the United States that have been specifically tailored to encourage a wider diversity of renewable energy technologies, and solar energy in particular. As shown here, state-level RPS programs specifically designed to support solar have already proven to be an important driver for solar energy deployment, and those impacts are projected to build in the coming years. State experience in supporting solar energy with RPS programs is mixed, however, and full compliance with existing requirements has not been achieved. The comparative experiences described herein highlight the opportunities and challenges of applying an RPS to specifically support solar energy, as well as the importance of policy design details to ensuring that program goals are achieved.

	abstract = {Residential or 'rooftop' solar PV can play an important role in providing renewable energy, thus offsetting fossil fuel based generation and associated greenhouse gas emissions. In Australia, subsidies are offered to encourage the deployment of residential PV in the form of Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) and Feed-in Tariffs (FiTs). This paper provides a literature review of existing work which assesses renewable energy in Australia, and delves deeper into a residential PV specific analysis of available data across the five criteria of installation, employment, market maturity, FiT settings and environmental outcomes to assess successes, failures and impacts of Australian residential PV policies between 2001 and 2012. This analysis identifies overall success with regard to environmental and deployment goals, and limited success in the goal of renewable energy industry promotion, which is devoid of indigenous manufacturing. In addition, impacts, including the dominance of the FiT as the initial stimulus for rapid PV deployment, cost impacts on electricity bills for various FiT settings, and the dependence of PV employment numbers on the continuation of the FiT are also identified. Finally, inequitable outcomes due to the FiT, such as cross-subsidisation from non-solar to solar households are also detailed. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this context, the authors of this paper argue that the development of robust and viable distributed power grids will also depend in the future on improving small wind generation as an important alternative to the diversity of decentralized power grids. In this study, the authors present an overview of the small-sized Aeolic (or wind) energy market in Brazil, with the objective to support the debate regarding its expansion. Promoting the small wind market in Brazil is still a big challenge, but lessons can be learned from the United States. In this context, the article uses the United States learning curve, analyzing barriers that were found, as well as public policies implemented to overcome them. The lessons learned in the American market may guide public policies aimed at fostering this technology in Brazil. If technological improvements, certification and introduction of financial incentives were implemented in Brazil, the small wind industry chain could grow substantially, building a trajectory to promote the low carbon economy.},

	abstract = {By contrast to the common objective of decarbonization of electricity production, the main driver of Russia's renewable energy policy is to achieve the economic benefits related to the manufacturing of green equipment. The focus on industrial development rather than the decarbonization of the power sector clearly appears from the decision of the Russian government to tie renewable energy subsidies to stringent local content requirements. In particular, solar energy benefits from a subsidy regime that is favourable to local manufacturers. Based on a detailed analysis of Russian renewable energy regulation, this paper studies the benefits for solar generation and explains this favourable treatment based on the vested interests of influential industrial groups in the solar PV manufacturing sector. These vested interests helped to overcome the resistance to renewable energy in an economy heavily dependent on oil and gas. More fundamentally, the influence of the local solar energy industry enabled the development of a support scheme that eventually stimulated the deployment of renewable energy technologies in general.},

	abstract = {To date, Irish policymakers have struggled to implement effective decarbonisa-tion policy. At the same time, some approaches to climate mitigation, such as increasing the carbon price, and wind energy developments, have been met with protest, whilst other citizens are protesting to demand even further climate action. This presents a dilemma for policymakers, in a context in which time to enact successful policy to avoid global climate breakdown is running out. Fortunately, a more dynamic understanding of policy is emerging within the literature. This offers insights for policymakers and academics alike, seeking to understand how to deliberately accelerate decarbonisation. Importantly, these theories of policy feedback and coalition building provide insights into how policy can be enacted in a way that builds support for the future ratcheting up of climate policy strin-gency. Drawing on this recent literature, this paper provides in-depth insights into the historic case of the German energy transition, in particular the use of feed-in tariff policies. It also provides an overview of the development of renewables policy in the Irish case, outlining its core claim that feed-in tariff approaches offer significant economic, social and environmental benefits in transition processes. The paper provides important insights for those seeking to understand how to develop successful climate policy in Ireland going forward. © 2020, Royal Irish Academy. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This review investigates the potential of photovoltaics in southern Europe and Middle East/North Africa in terms of PV status and policies/initiatives for PV market development in the region. In some Sunbelt countries, PV has become a competitive alternative for electricity generation resulting from a combination of high solar resource, decreasing PV system costs and high fuel prices. The PV levelized cost of electricity has fallen in some regions to 0.08 (sic)/kWh whilst retail electricity prices are almost three times higher in some cases attesting to the ideal conditions in the region for PV uptake. In grid parity regions of south Europe, incentives such as feed-in-tariffs have served their purpose. Net metering and self consumption are proving to be good solutions for driving effectively the PV market as evidenced for the case of Cyprus. In MENA countries, the renewables policy landscape, although still at an exploratory phase, is rapidly developing providing the backbone for a large number of new PV projects. This reflects the region's commitment to meet its ambitious national targets regarding PV. Overall, the timing for the whole region is excellent to achieve energy sustainability, once better policies are adopted and challenges regarding grid integration and reliability are addressed.

	abstract = {The deployment of electric vehicles has attracted growing attention and is now seen as a possible pathway for a transition towards sustainable transportation. This paper provides insight into the commercialization of electric vehicles in Shenzhen focusing on business innovation and the regulatory context in which it occurs. Using the business model canvas framework, this paper analyzes interactions between enterprises and governments along the value chain of electric vehicles in the bus and taxi fleets. It also discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the Shenzhen model both in business innovation and government regulation for promoting electric vehicle use. This paper finds that Shenzhen has succeeded in fostering a distinct government-enterprise cooperation model that not only reduces the financial pressure on the local government to promote electric vehicle use, but also gives enterprises significant leeway to experiment with various innovative business models. The joint result of these efforts is that the commercialization of electric vehicles has become feasible for delivering the public transport service (buses and taxis) in Shenzhen. Still, this paper argues that the current model of Shenzhen can be further enhanced by: 1) encouraging private investment in charging infrastructures by means of public-private-partnerships; and 2) standardizing electric-vehicle technologies and production to break down the local protectionism in the electric vehicle market. The Shenzhen model acts as a source of inspiration by pointing out the significance of integrating business innovations and government regulations to facilitate the deployment of electric vehicles, which provides practical lessons for industrial players and policy makers in other cities. Furthermore, this work offers theoretical references regarding the application of the multi-actor perspective and the business model canvas framework to analyze the actors and interactions along the value chain of innovative technologies.

However, the target of EV deployment was not achieved despite strong political support. As a result, the government modified the initial plan by reducing the target number of EVs from 1 million to 200,000. Many EV experts thought the issue arose from poor policy framework and implementation process. The purpose of this paper is to find relevant policy direction in Korea by comparing the policy formulation and implementation process between EU countries and Korea. Concerning policy formulation, we examined the legislation and planning process to know what to prepare for successful EV policy framework. And for the policy implementing process, we analyzed various incentive measures on how to stimulate the deployment of EV. With comparative research results EV policy implications are drawn. © 2015 WEVA.},

In this direction, the deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles that rely on low greenhouse gas emission electricity generation has great potential to significantly alleviate the dependence on fossil fuel consumption in the transport sector. In this study, the policy incentives that different countries have implemented for stimulating the market of EVs are presented. Different policy instruments are examined, in order to support the deployment of EVs in Greece. Based on data from previous study, where total costs of ownership have been calculated, three alternative policy support incentives have been developed and analysed to promote the use of EVs until 2030 in Greece. Results indicate the direct subsidy scheme is more favourable over a carbon taxation system. It is suggested that EV will be competitive with ICE in the year 2022/2023, if no additional policies are implemented in Greece. This study fills the gap in the literature by offering a policy view of the main measures as well of actions that need to be taken in Greece, in order to promote electromobility.},

Current policy mixes in most countries are not nearly stringent enough. We argue that most regions need a stronger, more integrated policy mix led by stringent regulations and complemented by pricing mechanisms as well as other efforts to reduce vehicle travel. As road transport emissions are set to grow, stronger policy mixes are needed to reach mitigation goals. This Perspective considers the evidence for several policy types-strong regulation, pricing and reduced travel-and the best combination to reduce emissions for passenger and freight vehicles.},

The authors analysed the policy strategies that countries have put to practice and analyse how they have performed so far. Arguably, many countries appear to be on track to achieving their short-term goals; in that sense, EV policy is successful. However, once the longer term policy goals for e-mobility are taken into account, it is unlikely that the current policies will be sufficient.

	abstract = {Southeast Asia is a significant stakeholder in the global action against climate change, given its growing population, rising greenhouse gas emissions, and vulnerability to climate change impacts. Public policy makers in this region are faced with the challenge of transitioning to cleaner energy sources to enable the attainment of Paris Agreement goals, while also expanding access to affordable and reliable energy supplies. Southeast Asia has one of world's fastest growing rates of greenhouse gas emissions due to rising fossil fuel combustion, second only to South Asia. As such, it is imperative to decouple its energy consumption from emissions growth. This paper reviews Southeast Asia's energy sector trends, with a focus on electricity supply and demand vis-à-vis global decarbonization efforts. Based on global and regional best practices, the paper highlights the crucial role that governments and public policy can play in accelerating the region's clean energy transition, namely through the establishment of mandatory long-term climate and renewable energy targets and binding policies; use of iterative and adaptive power system planning; support for effective market development; financing of pioneering investments and trunk infrastructure; and support for a just and equitable transition. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

To achieve this objective, the EU has explicitly stated targets for greenhouse reduction, shares of renewable energy sources (RES), and energy efficiency improvements for 2020 and 2030. In this paper, we focus on the drivers, barriers and enablers to achieving the EU's RES targets (20\% by 2020 and 27\% by 2030). Effective energy policies play a key role in the deployment of RES technologies. In order to design effective policies, a clear understanding of past trends and projections for future deployment is required. In this paper, we first analyse the past deployment of RES technologies for electricity supply (RES-E) in selected EU Member States. This highlights the key drivers, barriers, and enablers for deployment of RES in the past. In a second step, we conduct a meta-analysis of projections for RES-E shares from multiple well-established studies. Such an analysis will help in supporting the design of more effective energy policies and successfully achieving the EU's energy targets.},

	abstract = {The design of energy policies, particularly those focused on supporting renewable energy sources, is crucial for facing the major challenges of combining economic growth and sustainable development. This paper focuses on forty-six countries across the world, in three datasets of Global, European, and OECD countries. The timespan under analysis runs from 1996 until 2017, which makes it possible to capture the effects of renewable energy policies in their introductory phase. The policy-related database has been in construction since 1971, the date of the first implemented policy to support renewables. This paper contributes to the literature by assessing the nature of the effects of energy policies on both the installed capacity and the electricity generated by wind power, solar photovoltaic, and a multiple of all non-hydro renewables. A further major innovation of this paper is that it assesses both the short- and long-run effects of adjustments dynamics in policies for implementing renewable energy. The characteristics of the datasets required the use of the Driscoll and Kraay estimator with fixed effects. The results reveal that public policies have dissimilar effects in the short-run and the longrun. It is known that policy-based instruments are essential to implement renewable energy in both the short- and long-run. On the whole, the majority of these instruments are directly linked with public budgets, a position which can lead to an excessive burden on economies. Conversely, market-based instruments have been shown to promote the deployment of renewable energy only in the long-run. The results show that market-based instruments are not capable of promoting the early diffusion of renewable technologies into the market, i.e., in the short-run. In fact, market-based instruments are only effective when renewable technologies are mature and well-integrated in the electricity market, i.e., in the long-run. Therefore, this suggests that an optimal public policy involves a mix of policy-based instruments to enable early market diffusion, and a mix of market-based instruments to maintain investment in renewable energies in the long-run.

	abstract = {Public transport is important for Sweden to acquire a fossil-fuel independent vehicle fleet by 2030. The aim of this paper is to assess the status of Swedish public bus fleets towards decarbonization, and explore factors affecting regional performance variations and fuel choices. Environmental performance indicators such as renewable fuel shares, CO2 emissions, and energy efficiency are analyzed nationally and regionally. Fuel preferences and best practices are investigated through a survey and interviews with experts working with strategic planning at Public Transport Authorities. Almost 60\% of the bus transport volume ran on renewables in 2014 compared to 8\% in 2007, but regional variations are significant, partly due to factors such as driving conditions, bus and fuel types, typical trip lengths, and climatic conditions. However, there is no strong correlation between population densities or bus transport volume and the share of renewables achieved. This places political will, strategic planning and policies to promote public transport as key factors affecting renewable fuel deployment. Environmental factors are a priority when choosing fuels, while barriers to renewable fuels are mainly economic and political. Meanwhile, despite the overall progress, achievements in energy efficiency improvement are falling short in comparison to emissions reduction and adoption of renewable fuels, thus requiring further attention.

	abstract = {Concentrated solar power (CSP) is a promising technology for low-carbon energy systems, as combined with thermal storage it can store solar energy as heat, and deliver power more flexibly and when most needed by the grid. However, its high cost prevents its rapid deployment and affects its affordability in emerging economies. International financial institutions (IFIs) have emerged as key players to enable CSP in emerging economies, especially when cooperating with national policymakers. Through the analysis of two CSP plants in India and Morocco where IFIs provided the lion's share of finance, this paper aims to assess the effectiveness of their support and estimate the impact of IFIs financing on electricity production costs and mobilization of private investments. The two case studies show that public financial institutions can play a leading role in reducing the cost of CSP support on public budgets by providing concessional loans in countries where public and/or private finance would be too expensive, or extending maturities where commercial investors are present but poorly suited for project finance. Finally, we show that, combined with competitive tariff setting mechanism (tenders and auctions), public financial support can also be a cost-effective tool to engage private investors in CSP.

Research suggests that RPSs are supported by Democratic legislatures in states with good solar and wind potential, are more likely in states with restructured electricity markets, and are less likely in states heavily dependent on natural gas for electricity generation. Research also suggests that RPSs have been successful at increasing renewable generation capacity, have increased the cost of electricity modestly where they have been implemented, and reduce carbon emissions at a cost roughly consistent with estimates of the social cost of carbon.},

	abstract = {Voluntary business activities, such as the voluntary action plans conducted by comprehensive business associations in Japan to reduce environmental damage, are viable policy instruments alongside regulations and economic incentives (e.g. taxes and emissions trading schemes). This paper examines three case studies in which voluntary activities have played a successful role in mitigating climate change. Based on interviews with business organisations together with a literature review and data analysis, we show why businesses are motivated to take socially responsible actions and describe the major benefits of such activities. One of the important benefits of voluntary activities is their flexibility in phasing measures. This flexibility is greatly appreciated, since industries are able to retain control of their responses to future uncertainties, which allows them to tackle climate change issues aggressively. We conclude that voluntary activities have been more environmentally effective than alternative policy measures under a proper institutional framework, which consists of effective motivation mechanisms for businesses, governmental measures to encourage their compliance, and capable industrial associations that can lessen the transaction costs both of the government and of industry.

Our results show that regional interventions operate as a push/pull mechanism in driving companies to be more environmentally friendly. This is important for identification of policy-driven changes which make some regions more successful than others in sustainability transition.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.envsci.2017.12.007},
	abstract = {In 1990 Austria has committed to the Kyoto-protocol and later to the Paris Agreement. Since then, it has developed two climate strategies, has passed its first climate protection act, has adopted a strategy for adaptation to climate change and has implemented many new institutions, programmes and local to provincial climate change mitigation (CCM) measures. Indeed, Austrian GHG-emissions have been decreasing since 2005, giving reasons to suspect policy success. A closer analysis, however, challenges this impression. Here, we put climate policies since 1990 into perspective with other, often short-term drivers of GHG-emissions. Employing a conceptual framework, we evaluate the level of climate policy integration, which has been found key for successful climate policies in literature. This framework also helps us to detect benefits and shortcomings of past and existing CCM policies and so to derive insights relevant for policy-makers. We find that short-term climatic and socio-economic events overruled climate policies in their proximate GHG-emission effects, even when policies were implemented due to EU regulation after 2007. Policy effects are much more difficult to uncover, because they often happen within longer time-frames and are usually accompanied by indirect CCM-effects. In the background of accelerating climate change impacts in combination with associated high uncertainties, strengthening climate policies and integrating reflexive mechanisms that allow adjusting and continuously re-evaluating policy effectiveness, will become ever more important. Eliminating inconsistencies between CCM- and other sectoral policies and drastically reforming accounting schemes to include carbon leakage effects are particularly timely, yet considering political realities, very bold but necessary next step to make climate goals attainable.},

Using data from 136 countries between 1996 and 2016, we provide unique and compelling evidence that transcendent institutional measures and conscious government policies for environmentally sound and sustainable economic growth can effectively reduce CO2 emissions. Our research reveals that effective climate change policies must be associated with improvement in at least three main institutional dimensions: protection of property rights (the rule of law), citizens' participation in elections and freedom of expression (voice), and control of corruption. Climate-friendly economic policies must consider improving such institutional features while simultaneously advancing economic development, increasing the use of renewable energy by private and public entities, and significantly reducing the consumption of fossil fuels. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

Drawing on climate policy making, this article argues that the division of labor between the bureaucracy and legislature in policy formulation is a critical source of state capacity. In cases of bureaucratic policy design, the legislature sets policy goals and delegates policy design to bureaucracies. This division of labor shifts distributional conflict to autonomous bureaucracies, allowing for effective policy design. California followed this path in climate policy making, setting it on track to meet climate goals. In cases of legislative policy design, bureaucracies set goals and legislatures design policy measures. Since legislators have incentives to respond to vested interests, legislative policy design is vulnerable to regulatory capture. In Germany, legislative policy design in climate policy making is preventing attainment of emissions reduction goals, as industry interests succeeded in blocking key policy measures. Our findings highlight procedural sources of state capacity.},

In the last two decades, several carbon pricing policies have been implemented or debated at the state and federal levels in the US. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and the California cap-and-trade policy are the two regional policies operational today. While there is no federal policy operational today, several carbon pricing proposals have been introduced in Congress in the last decade. Using the literature on interest group politics and policy entrepreneurship, this article examines the carbon pricing policies at the subnational and federal levels in the US. First, the article explores the evolution of two main regional carbon pricing policies, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and California cap-and-trade, to identify how interest groups and policy entrepreneurs shaped the design and implementation of the respective policies. Second, the article details the federal carbon pricing policy proposals and bills discussed in the last decade. Third, it examines the factors that limit the prospects of realizing an ambitious federal carbon price for pursuing deep decarbonization of the US economy. The article finds that federal carbon pricing in the US suffers from the lack of any natural and/or consistent constituency to support it through policy development, legislation, and implementation. While interest group politics have been mitigated by good policy entrepreneurship at the subnational level, the lack of policy entrepreneurship and the changing positions of competing interest groups have kept a federal carbon pricing policy from becoming a reality.},

We equally give an initial measurable calculation of the impact of government explicit financing on non-government financing into conventional electricity generation sources for 22 OECD nations in the year 2001-2018. Applying FGLS and non-dynamic and non-static GMM regressors, we discover that government financing unilaterally has an explicit and nevertheless reliably the most impacts on non-government financing movements compared to feed-in tariffs (FiTs), taxes, and renewable purchase obligations (RPS) in all and regarding wind and solar sources differently. Ramifications for policy geared towards fast-tracking the energy transition are deliberated. We highlighted those important dedications to scale-up wind and solar energy demands organized by financiers such as asset funding. Furthermore, to arrive at the energy crossover to a carbon-free power system, government and non-government financiers have to continue financing and expand their activities in financing studies, demonstration, and initial scale-up. We reveal that the delivery of government finance is directly correlated with non-government funding movements. Furthermore, we postulate that government policy incentives for non-government financing, nevertheless, have impacts of unconventional energy sources share on non-government financing more than those of FiTs. Ultimately, the supply of conventional fuels is a significant impediment to solar energy financing, while the existence of other sources of cleaner energies promotes non-government climate finance.},

	abstract = {The rapid global deployment of solar photovoltaic (PV) technologies since the early 2000s has attracted sustained attention. Solar PV has become an increasingly established, widespread and flexible form of electricity generation. In the research language of socio-technical or energy transitions, solar PV can reasonably be viewed as acquiring the characteristics of a 'socio-technical regime.' Such regimes are found where a co-evolving set of social and technical developments have built sufficient momentum for a particular technology to become accepted as an established part of the energy provision system. As solar PV becomes integrated into the project of providing secure, affordable and sustainable energy for development, this momentum is now spreading across sub-Saharan Africa. In this article, we examine the emergence and adoption of solar PV in Mozambique and South Africa. While solar PV has gained ground in both cases, it has done so in different ways and with varying consequences. Our analysis suggests that even as niche technologies reach maturity and transcend the contexts from which they have emerged, they remain constituted through multiple sets of relations that are continually remade, such that the geographies, histories and politics of transitions are an ongoing project. Such a perspective, drawing on energy geographies and landscape studies, can enrich the sustainability transitions literature, enhancing our understanding of different ways of developing and adopting solar PV in particular places.},

	abstract = {We develop a novel, mixed methods approach to examine the relationship between political ideology and support for renewable energy and energy efficiency (REEE) policies. Through qualitative analysis of interviews with state-government legislators in the U.S., we show that when legislators evaluate and justify their support for and opposition to different types of renewable energy and energy efficiency (REEE) policies, they distinguish bills based on frames that are related to ideological differences (e.g., tax decreases, government efficiency, regulation, mandates, government spending). In turn the qualitative distinctions among bills are associated with quantitative differences in levels of support and success for the policies. Using data from a longitudinal analysis of 188 major state-government laws passed from 2004 to 2014 and a cross-sectional set of 709 passed and unpassed laws from 2011 to 2012, we show that REEE policies configured as mandates (e.g., renewable portfolio standards) have consistently lower levels of support than for similar REEE policies configured as tax reductions, reduction of government waste by increasing building efficiency, authorization of local government action, and regulatory reduction. Thus, via both quantitative and qualitative analysis, we show that there are important ideology-associated differences in REEE policy that point to opportunities for more successful policy design.

Design/methodology/approach This paper investigates new geothermal law and its implications for geothermal development in Indonesia by using comparable law article to discuss this development. All the data are obtained from literature studies based on the history and background, ownership and access, investment and risks, electricity market and re-policies, environmental regulations and community participation around the geothermal resources. Findings Geothermal industries in Indonesia need assurance and clear legal basis to be developed. Geothermal investors, whether foreign or local, need policy assurance and good business structures that can create a secure investment environment. Furthermore, a good relationship with international cooperation agency needs to be improved to establish knowledge transfer regarding technologies and information about exploration, production and geothermal development. This is essential to further develop the geothermal utilization and prepare Indonesia to be the country with the biggest reduction in CO2 emission in 2025. New geothermal regulation (Law No.21 Year 2014) has facilitated the geothermal activities. After the issuance of this regulation, the activities can be done at conserved, production and conservation forest. Moreover, the public service agency (BLU) or state-owned enterprise (BUMN) assignment scheme can boost the geothermal industries development. Originality/value Indonesia has huge geothermal resources because of its geological condition that is located at volcanoes path, also known as Ring of Fire. According to 2017 ESDM data, Indonesia's geothermal potentials are almost 30 GW and are distributed to 331 potential points. However, only 5 per cent of those potentials (1,643.5 MW) have been utilized to date. The huge potentials can be utilized optimally to support the Government's plan in achieving the energy security. Therefore, policies that regulate geothermal utilization is strategically essential for Indonesia's future.},

To answer the question, this article examines three decades of energy and climate policies in China. By providing an overarching review, it contributes new and updated research on drivers behind long-term climate policies and whether China's long-term emissions trend can be broken by placing greater emphasis on innovation, technology and low-carbon development. Importantly, it analyses the most recent policy developments in China, such as the likely effects of China's recent 2060 carbon neutrality goal. We conclude that after the Paris Agreement, the biggest policy change has been technological innovation in the power and transport sector. China has prioritized measures, laws and policies for developing renewable energy, especially solar and wind. China has also embraced the 'green growth' approach for responding to the challenges of climate change. These efforts have yielded results, and China has emerged as a world leader in renewable energy. However, there is still a long way to go.

	doi = {10.3280/EFE2020-001003},
	abstract = {Purpose To mitigate energy and environmental challenges, several countries worldwide are considering different policies to promote the use of electric vehicles (EVs). Consequently, the necessity of studies focusing on the important and effective EV policy measures are developing as policymakers are seeking to prioritize the policy measures based on their usefulness to achieve mass EV adoption. This study reviews evidence from China and Norway to identify factors that could substantially accelerate demand for EVs. Method We emphasize the cases of Norway and China, as these countries have already initiated incentive-strong policies to accelerate EV's acceptance in their market and have succeeded considerably in improving their EV market share during the early adoption phases. The findings and discussion of this study is principally based on the reviewed literature of related policy measures and two cases of successful EV uptake policies, Findings The evidence points at the significance of EV policy measures such as purchasebased and use-based incentives, availability of publicly accessible charging infrastructures, availability of EVs in the local market and collective communication measures. As findings, we have developed a general framework of essential EV policy measures. The reviewed literature and cases suggest that publicly accessible charging infrastructures and financial incentives play crucial role in uptake. Conclusion Our study suggests that to accelerate EV penetration in the market, it is required the policymakers to pay more attention to the policy measures included in our general framework. However, the magnitude of the influences and interplay between these policy measures may differ between regions and on the context. Hence, policymakers should reconsider and restructure the EV polices after a certain level of EV-uptake is realized in the market. © 2020 Franco Angeli Edizioni. All rights reserved.},

Over the years, development cooperation has pivoted towards recipient country capacity building under broadly defined climate-related aid. In the energy sector of aid recipient countries, aid projects are influential in financing deployment of low-carbon technologies as well as policy advice and reforms, mobilizing private investments, network strengthening, and rural electrification support. Future projects and programs in this sector need to be cognizant of recipient country expectations. This study explores the outlook for future projects managing energy transition through targeted interventions. Employing content analysis of Technology Action Plan documents for twenty-five countries, activities under prioritized technologies were matched with indicators corresponding to seven functions of a technological innovation system. Resource mobilization and creation of legitimacy were the functions prioritized by the countries, while the function of entrepreneurial activity received less priority. The innovation system indicators identified in the literature and used in the study are useful measures that can complement design of donor interventions aimed at accelerating adoption \& diffusion of energy technologies. These findings could be used to support further development of Nationally Determined Contributions and accelerated deployment of climate mitigation technologies in national strategies and programs for sustainable development.},

We also describe the government's renewable energy policy and its success in renewable electricity generation as well as increasing renewable energy innovation and foreign knowledge accumulation, which may drive export performance. We aim at empirically identifying determinants of Chinese solar PV and WETC exports. We estimate a gravity trade model using maximum likelihood estimation. Besides controlling for standard variables, we consider additional explanatory factors by accounting for market, policy and innovation effects steaming from both importing countries and China. We use a panel dataset representing bilateral trade flows of 43 developed and developing countries that imported solar PV and WETCs from China between 1996 and 2008. Empirical results indicate that high income countries, with large renewable energy markets and demand side policy support schemes, in terms of incentive tariffs, are increasingly importing Chinese solar PV components. We show that trade costs have a negative impact on exports of solar PV components but not WETC. Additionally, we find a positive impact of research and development appropriation growth, especially from provincial governments in China, but no evidence that bilateral knowledge transfer and indigenous innovation affect exports.},

Our analysis is based on a novel analytical framework which enriches the literature on policy mixes for sustainability transitions with concepts from the Advocacy Coalition Framework. Methodologically, we conduct a qualitative analysis drawing on document analysis and expert interviews. We find that the design of the Argentinean policy mix has been influenced by a dominant advocacy community with fiscal concerns and investments in renewable energy as its main beliefs, thereby limiting national industry development.

In response, Germany adopted the Federal Climate Change Act (CCA) in 2019. We analyze the state of climate governance in Germany before the CCA, the main design elements of the CCA, and assess the potential of the CCA to change German climate governance. Drawing on policy integration theory and 26 semi-structured interviews with senior policymakers and stakeholders, we find that German climate governance before the CCA was only moderately integrated. The sectoral emission targets legislated by the CCA make climate change mitigation a priority sector goal in non-energy sectors, and CCA provisions for monitoring, assessing and implementing policy reforms promise to enhance alignment of instruments with targets over time. Overall, the CCA advances a multi- rather than cross-sector climate governance, failing to advance coordination across sectors and ministries.},

	abstract = {This article reviews climate change mitigation policies implemented in five major emitting economies: China, the European Union, India, Japan and the United States. It analyses their historical performance in terms of energy system and greenhouse gas emissions indicators. In cases where policies aim to reduce future emissions, their target performance levels are assessed. The review centres on the sectors of electricity generation, passenger vehicles, freight transport, forestry, industry, buildings, agriculture, and oil and gas production. Most focus countries have implemented successful policies for renewable energy, fuel efficiency, electrification of passenger vehicles, and forestry. For other sectors, information is limited or very heterogeneous (e.g. buildings, appliances, agriculture) or there are few comprehensive policies in place (e.g. industry). The article further presents an explorative emissions scenario developed under the assumption that all countries will replicate both the observed trends in sector-level indicators and the trends that policies for future emissions reductions aspire to achieve. It shows that the global replication of sector progress would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 by about 20\% compared to a current policies scenario. All countries analysed would overachieve the emissions reduction targets in their post-2020 climate targets. However, the resulting reduction in global emissions by 2030 would still not be sufficient to keep the world on track for a global cost-effective pathway that keeps temperature increase below 2 degrees C. The findings of this study emphasise the need for transformative policies to keep the Paris Agreement temperature limit within reach.},

	abstract = {Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are declining in all major sectors in the European Union, with the exception of one sector that has seen a significant increase in GHG emissions over the past decade - transport sector. The European transport sector faces a significant challenge in achieving the decarbonization goal set by the European Green Deal. Although the European Commission is planning to introduce a set of EU-level measures, such as the inclusion of road transport in the EU Emissions Trading System, the progress of greening the transport sector has so far largely depended on national policies. To understand whether European countries are committed to rapidly adapt to low-carbon transport systems, it is crucial to evaluate what progress have national policies achieved so far in moving towards a sustainable transport system. This study used a three-level assessment of transport sector sustainability across European countries. First, this study assessed the overall sustainability level of the transport sector in all European Union Member States and the United Kingdom using the composite sustainability index method for cross-country comparison. Countries were compared using 15 transport indicators grouped into four dimensions (mobility, sustainability, innovation, and environment) based on the latest available data from 2017 obtained from Eurostat, European Commission, and Odysee-Mure databases. Second, in order to identify the dynamics of progress, Logistic Mean Division Index (LMDI) decomposition analysis was conducted to assess the changes in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the transport sector over ten years, taking into account the five main factors: emission intensity effect, renewable energy (RES) transition effect, energy intensity effect, economic growth effect, and population growth effect. Third, to analyse what has impacted the sustainability of the transport sector in countries, the study highlighted several key policies (directions) for decarbonizing transport from the analysis outlining the good practice policies from the best performing countries. The combined results of the composite sustainability index and decomposition analysis revealed significant differences between Nordic, Western, and Eastern European countries, suggesting that different approaches should be taken in developing effective sustainability policies for transport.},

	abstract = {PurposeAlthough the tasks of managing carbon peaks and achieving carbon neutrality in China are arduous, they are also of great significance, which highlights China's determination and courage in dealing with climate change. The power industry is not only a major source of carbon emissions but also an important area for carbon emission reduction. Thus, against the backdrop of carbon neutrality, understanding the development status of China's power industry guided by the carbon neutrality background is important because it largely determines the completeness of China's carbon reduction promises to the world. This study aims to review China's achievements in carbon reduction in the electric industry, its causes and future policy highlights. Design/methodology/approachThe methods used in this study include descriptive analyses based on official statistics, government documents and reports. FindingsThe research results show that, after years of development, the power industry has achieved positive results in low-carbon provisions and in the electrification of consumption, and carbon emission intensity has continued to decline. Policy initiatives play a key role in this process, including, but not limited to, technology innovations, low-carbon power replacement and supported policies for low-carbon transformation toward low-carbon economies. Originality/valueThis study provides a full picture of China's power industry against the backdrop of low-carbon development, which could be used as a benchmark for other countries engaging in the same processes. Moreover, a careful review of China's development status may offer profound implications for policymaking both for China and for other governments across the globe.},

The creative and disruptive policy measures in Norway ' s climate policy mix are analysed by focusing on both national and international climate mitigation efforts. Norway ' s climate policy mix at home has been more ambitious in the transport sector with a growing electric vehicle market than in the energy sector where niche support and disruptive policies have remained weak. Abroad, Norway has been increasingly active in supporting new low-carbon technologies and disrupting the fossil-fuel industry, especially coal. This is explained by the consensus-seeking and oil and gas dominated small-state social-investment political economy in Norway, combined with a forward-looking foreign policy based on norm-setting and multilateralism.},

	abstract = {U.S. cities are now taking a more active role in clean energy transitions with a variety of policies for decarbonization, net-zero emissions, and renewable energy. We focus on the adoption of one rapidly growing policy trend: commitments for 100\% renewable electricity (100RE). Over 180 U.S. cities and towns have made these pledges, most since the 2016 election. Remarkably, they have been adopted by many small towns and cities that are not typically leaders in sustainability policy. To explore potential drivers of policy adoption, we conduct a matched-pair analysis of municipalities with and without 100RE pledges. We find that municipalities that adopt 100RE policies are no more likely to have municipal utilities, such that successful implementation will likely require institutional innovation. The unexpected correlation with higher poverty rates suggests that policies will need to be carefully designed to minimize rate impacts. Although these results raise implementation challenges, we also find that 100RE adopters are more likely to have institutions for sustainability governance, local colleges and universities, and experience with energy efficiency policy, which may assist them in designing effective policies.},

	abstract = {Europe's two largest economies - Germany and the UK - are phasing out coal from electricity production as part of European efforts to fulfil increased climate policy ambitions that require comprehensive energy system transitions. German and UK governments varied in the ways they sought support from diverse societal interests to make the transition socially acceptable and politically feasible. Drawing on 22 expert interviews and process-tracing methods, this paper compares and explains how political and economic institutional differences influenced efforts to balance energy transition concerns, like speed and cost-effectiveness with justice for companies, workers and communities most adversely affected by the transition. We find that the increasing attention to just transition perspectives after the Paris Agreement affected the design of coal phase-out processes in different ways in the two countries. Just transition concerns were given priority by policymakers in Germany, but more so if they overlapped with the interests of incumbents. In the end, politically powerful stakeholders dominated the policy outcome. In the UK, policymakers and stakeholders gave only weak attention to just transition concerns, mainly because coal's market position had collapsed. Coal interests did not have strong representation in the decision-making process. But we find that just transition concerns are likely to gain more attention in the UK because a more challenging transition away from gas will take place over the next two decades. Key policy insights Policymakers must balance the objective of a fast decarbonization process against two other important concerns: cost-effectiveness and a just transition. Political-economic institutional design and capacity shape the extent to which just transition concerns are given weight in coal phase-out processes. State capacity for including just transition concerns in coal phase-out processes is higher when political and economic institutions strongly mediate government-stakeholder interaction in the policy process, and broad stakeholder participation increases the political feasibility and legitimacy of policy change. In Germany, the government's attention to just transition concerns was strong because broad stakeholder representation in the formal process, and transition assistance policies to target potential losers in the transition, became crucial to enhance the legitimacy of coal phase-out policies. In the UK, cost-effectiveness trumped just transition concerns in the coal phase-out process, but just transition issues have increasing salience and will likely become pertinent in the upcoming gas phase-out process because more jobs and key economic interests are at stake. Our findings are relevant for policymakers in countries struggling with balancing speed, cost-effectiveness and just transition concerns in similar transition processes: phasing out coal, gas, or oil from their energy system. The findings may also inform future energy transition research.},

The study surveys all multi-government CCA programs in the state, evaluating their characteristics and governance structures. Three regional areas are examined in-depth through policymaker and stakeholder interviews, media coverage, and decision-making outcomes.

	abstract = {For centuries, coal mining played a crucial role in Germany's socio-economic history. It not only drove its industrialization but also supported its recovery after World War II. Since the middle of the 20th century in Germany, this industry entered a deep crisis mainly due to its high production costs. This led to the final closure of German hard coal mining in 2018. In Colombia, coal mining has also played an important economic role, especially since the 1980s when the large concessions began. In Germany, the closure of this industry has entailed great challenges, which have been addressed through regional structural transformation processes that continue today. Likewise, Germany's plan to phase out coal from its energy matrix has also entailed great challenges that have increased due to the current energy crisis in Europe. In the case of Colombia, global trends to reduce coal consumption will inevitably affect its national finances in the medium term. A comparative analysis of scenarios of these two countries, along with some projections of energy and coal consumption at world level, show that certain German experiences, especially regarding the processes of regional structural change, can be useful in the definition of strategies for the Colombian context. © 2023 The Authors},

The study concentrates on the regulation of renewable energy generation with a focus on grid access and connection mechanisms. The high rate of distributed generation penetration is mainly based on the early support that these countries gave to the expansion of renewable energy generation - mainly wind and solar - within their respective national policies. Germany and Denmark are the ones with the most sophisticated support schemes, which have shown a dynamic design over time. In terms of connections, Germany has the most favorable connection regime which provides not only priority connection but also priority grid access for generation units that produce electricity from renewable energy sources. Sweden guarantees equal treatment among different technologies (i.e. a non-discrimination principle). High connection costs have been observed specially in Germany and Denmark. The costs of network upgrades are usually socialised across demand customers. However, integration issues should be taken into consideration in order to avoid expansion of distributed generation in a way which unnecessarily raises total system costs, via high connection costs.

	abstract = {Law is an important tool for national governments to promote the transition to a low carbon energy sector. However, law is the servant of national politics and policies and is embedded in a wider institutional environment, both nationally and internationally. This comparative analysis of the United Kingdom (UK) and China shows that, although national law plays a role in supporting the transition to a low-carbon energy system, the nature of the law and the role it plays depends greatly on the wider institutional environment. The UK is a parliamentary democracy and a liberal market economy. Therefore, the laws passed by the legislature form a critical part of the framework for the low-carbon transition. In contrast, the authority of the executive in China allows the executive to govern the energy sector through decrees and regulations, and diminishes the role of law passed by the legislature. Energy law and policy in both the UK and China are formulated in the light of the prevailing energy policy paradigm: the market-oriented regulatory state paradigm in the UK and a state-centered paradigm in China. Together, these differences explain the contrasting experiences in promoting the low-carbon transition, in general, and the deployment of renewable energy in particular. © 2015 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.},

	abstract = {India's electricity sector is in the midst of a transition that will have immense consequences for its own devel-opment and for global decarbonisation efforts. Sustainability transitions scholars have highlighted the impor-tance of integrating insights from multiple disciplinary perspectives to holistically understand national energy transitions. This search-based narrative review assesses the academic and policy literature on India's electricity sector transition from January 2011 to October 2022 and synthesizes it along three broad perspectives identified by Cherp et al. -techno-economic, political, socio-technical - and a fourth cross-cutting perspective 'justice'. It finds that India's electricity transition is state-led, with the state modulating the pace of the transition through its pro-renewables policies and its control over energy resources, assets and incumbents. India's national innovation systems is weak, leaving the state in-charge of stimulating transitions in line with its developmental objectives. While the policy-mix has successfully driven renewable energy deployment, it has been unable to stimulate manufacturing. A complete shift away from coal is likely to take multiple decades due to a young thermal fleet, multi-layered political lock-ins beyond jobs, demand-side uncertainties, and practical challenges with grid integration. Finally, it identifies six cross-cutting research gaps relating to (1) the role of the state (2) incumbents and non-state actors (3) green industrial policy (4) core political constituencies and institutional systems (5) economic diversification and social protection and (6) India's development pathway.},

Energy demand, energy access, energy security, the green collar jobs agenda and climate protection will all drive the industry forward. Public opposition and insufficient financial support can hold it back. To facilitate steady, sustainable growth of the renewable energy market, careful consideration of promotion policies will be necessary to ensure that the inherently distributed nature of renewable energy sources translates into diverse ownership, with broad support. Such support will drive the rapid deployment of these socially and economically beneficial and environmentally necessary technologies. This acceleration can be created through innovative democracy, which attempts to bring all actors into the decision-making process. When considered as a market driver for renewable energy, this equitable, participatory approach must be considered in conjunction with stable financial support schemes which allow diverse actors to engage the market. Lessons from Denmark and the United States show why this combination of conditions is central to the rapid deployment of renewable energy. Policymakers can assess the effectiveness of this approach by analysing which groups benefit most from the design of different policies.

	abstract = {Transport pricing (TP) can be a helpful policy instrument for climate action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and foster sustainable mobility. Yet few cities have implemented TP. The main barriers include a lack of public and political acceptance, especially in regions with entrenched socio-technical systems and cultures of automobility. The dominance of automobility can be a reason for TP to be unacceptable to the public and politicians. Yet, policies for low-carbon mobility may ultimately fail if they are designed within automobility. This article considers this tension in transport-pricing policy design, as a subset of broader climate policies. How can public acceptance be secured for TP, both navigating within automobility to gain sufficient public uptake but also beyond automobility towards more transformative climate action? This paper examines the proposed TP policy for Vancouver, Canada. We summarize what has been found to support public and political acceptance of TP in other cities, and then particularly look at Oslo, Norway. Our findings suggest that TP policy-design that parts with an automobility regime-and rather is carried out within a low-carbon paradigm-may confront greater short-term challenges with public acceptance, but will better position such an innovative policy for success on the long-term.},

We use new data to measure net taxes and subsidies for gasoline in almost all countries at the monthly level and find evidence of both progress and backsliding. From 2003 to 2015, gasoline taxes rose in 83 states but fell in 46 states. During the same period, the global mean gasoline tax fell by 13.3\% due to faster consumption growth in countries with lower taxes. Our results suggest that global progress towards fossil fuel price reform has been mixed, and that many governments are failing to exploit one of the most cost-effective policy tools for limiting greenhouse gas emissions.},

Moreover, different organizations evaluate the standards and regulations of charging stations and EV integration into the grid for Indian consumers. In India, the current status of the charging infrastructure and prospective expansion plans are analyzed. The initiatives of the central and state governments for the expansion of charging infrastructure and support for EV consumers are examined. For Indian society, the strong actions that can be taken to develop charging infrastructure are analyzed. Moreover, the obstacles to EV charging network expansion and the role and current status of the key aggregators in expanding the charging infrastructure are also analyzed by considering the Indian market.},

	abstract = {Energy renovation of buildings in the European Union would lead to considerable energy savings and a 26\% reduction in energy consumption. Despite this and the programmes implemented to promote it in the residential environment in Europe and the United States, the barriers that homes, contractors, and finance companies face to undertake these processes have slowed down the results. The emergence of one-stop-shops (OSSs), promoted by European directives, as integrated management entities to promote the energy renovation of dwellings seems to be a central element in the development of future strategies. This paper looks at experiences of implementing OSSs in Europe, tries to identify the main factors of success, and proposes lines of action to strengthen OSS operation in the long term. To achieve this, documents, regulations, and data on the context were studied, and active cases of OSSs were analysed. Experiences of OSSs that are no longer operating were identified to determine why they had closed down. The results suggested that a lack of structural funding is one reason why activities terminated and that the most successful cases applied an 'all inclusive' model and supported families in the entire process.},

Building on prior studies of the CCA while highlighting Germany as a counterfactual case study, we demonstrate the significant positive role that strategic framework legislation can play in improving climate policy integration and coherence. We further show that important new institutions can be established under the right historical conditions. Specifically, we argue that the political weakening of the UK coal sector was a necessary precursor to the adoption of strong climate policy and the emergence of a structural consensus towards accelerating climate ambition, as compared with Germany where consolidation of the coal regime has been a major factor in the country's failure to meet its emissions targets. We show how business associations and labour groups in the UK were a key supportive coalition for early climate action, while in Germany industry and organized labour have been key actors obstructing and delaying the passage of pro-climate reforms. Our study raises questions about the prospects for energy transitions that are both just and rapid, particularly by discussing the trade-offs between costeffectiveness, speed, and distributional concerns.},

In this paper, we surveyed existing WEEE collection and recycling system in three Asia-Pacific developing countries - China, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan, using SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) Analysis, analyzed key factors for an effective formal collection and recycling system, and identified priority fields that can be targeted by governments. Key factors that were considered include: government involvement, legislation, functional mechanisms, the presence/absence of advanced technology and facilities. Priorities for China were identified, including: expansion of WEEE scope that would be covered by the formal collection and recycling scheme, continued WEEE flow to the formal WEEE recycling sector, and enhancing law enforcement. For Sri Lanka, putting into place specific WEEE legislation and policies, establishing effective facilities for collection and recycling of a greater range of WEEE types, and the enhancement of pollution control are priorities. In Pakistan, commencement of government involvement and policy interventions on WEEE are considered to be of priority. General policy recommendations were also proposed for reference.},

Blending mandates continue to be the main market-pull policy used to create and expand biofuels markets. Countries with a mixture of market pull and technology-push policy instruments have been most successful at increasing biofuels production and use and also developing and deploying less mature advanced biofuels. Most policies have primarily promoted the production and use of biofuels for road transport with key long-distance transport sectors (aviation and shipping) drawing less policy attention despite being significant fuel consumers and carbon emitters. While many older policies were originally developed to promote energy security, more recent policies, such as low carbon fuel standard, have reduction in the carbon intensity of transportation fuels as a primary goal. While policies have been essential in promoting the on-going growth of biofuels, they have not been sufficient to drive the level of development needed to decarbonize the transport sector.},

Is there a more recent version of this paper?


Is it correct that each region can only invest in it’s own energy technologies? No foreign direct investments? or would foreign direct investments in region r be reflected by import of the generic good (money?) by r?


“In contrast to RICE, REMIND does not monetize climate damages,” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 4)


still true?




“REMIND distinguishes between the stationary end-use sector (aggregating industry and residential \& commercial) and the transport end-use sector.” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 9)


Is the commercial sector still reflected?




To remember:


energy system module accounts for regional endowments of primary energy resources / renewable energy potentials.


More than 50 technologies are available (PE2SE and SE2FE)


non-CO2 GHG emissions determined by marginal abatement costs curves relative to baseline emission levels that depend on activity variables or by assuming exogenous scenarios


Global learning curves represent endogenous technological change through learning-by-doing for wind and solar power, as well as electric and fuel cell vehicle technologies. The spillovers among regions caused by this global learning are not internalized in the non-cooperative market solution, whereas in the socially optimal cooperative solution they are.


The spacing of time steps is flexible. In the default case, there are five-year time steps until 2060, ten-year time steps until 2100 and twenty-year time steps after that. We typically focus analysis on the time span 2005-2100, but run the model until 2150 to avoid distortions due to end effects.
POLICY


In climate policy mode, imposes an additional climate policy constraint on the welfare maximization. Examples include limits on temperature, forcing, CO2 concentration, cumulative carbon budget, and CO2 emissions over time. REMIND calculates the corresponding mitigation costs as a reduction of consumption or GDP with respect to the baseline case.


We can also study the impact of a pre-specified carbon tax pathway. For such scenarios, REMIND implements the tax as a penalty on emissions. Since it assumes full recycling of tax revenues, the solution algorithm for such scenarios is less straightforward. It counterbalances the tax expenditure as part of each region’s budget constraint by a fixed amount of tax revenue that is recycled in a lump-sum manner. It then runs iteratively with adjusted tax revenues until it matches the level of tax payments.”


“REMIND also accounts for subsidies and taxes in the energy sector and implements them as a price mark-up on a region’s final demand of solids, heating oil, diesel, and petrol used in transport, as well as gas and electricity used in the stationary sector. ”


“In the default case, subsidies phase out by 2050. Historical data are based on the IEA subsidies database and the International Energy Database, ENERDATA” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 8)
GDP\&Population


“By default, we apply the population projections from IIASA and the GDP scenarios from the OECD” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 8)


By default, we use SSP2 scenario data as they represent a middle-of-the road scenario.” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 9)


“To calibrate GDP, which is an endogenous result of the growth engine in REMIND, we calibrate labor productivity parameters in an iterative procedure so as to reproduce the OECD's GDP reference scenarios. Within REMIND GDP is measured in market exchange rates (MER).” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 9)
2.2 Final Energy Demand


“REMIND distinguishes between the stationary end-use sector (aggregating industry and residential \& commercial) and the transport end-use sector.” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 9)


“REMIND represents transport and distribution of secondary energy carriers in terms of capacities that require investments and incur costs for operation and maintenance.


These costs shift the final energy supply curves and depend on the mode of transportation.” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 9)


“In REMIND, there are three mechanisms for reductions in energy intensity,”


“First, the efficiency parameters of the production function (exogenous) lead to autonomous reductions in energy intensity, which also occur in the absence of climate policy interventions. For 2005, the parameters are calibrated based on IEA energy balance sheets” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 9)(Luderer et al., 2015, p. 9)


“The model calibrates this factor separately for each region and each final energy type, so as to induce a gradual shift from solids and liquids to gases, transportation fuels and electricity, reflecting patterns of modernization observed in the past.” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 10)


“without climate policy based on the following guidelines: • Short- and mid-term final energy demand follows the trend for the years 2000-2010, which is consistent with most of the regional projections shown in the “current policy scenario” of IEA WEO 2010. • Per-capita energy use for the end-use of transport, non-electric stationary, and stationary electricity follow a converging trend between regions (EJ/capita over GDP in PPP/capita).” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 10)


“Second, the CES production function allows for price-dependent substitutions between aggregated energy and capital (substitution elasticity of 0.5).”


“The introduction of additional constraints on the supply side (e.g., carbon taxes, resource, or emission constraints) results in higher energy prices and thus lower final energy consumption” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 10)


“In absence of distortions, a reduction in final energy results in a lower GDP and, subsequently, lower consumption and welfare values.” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 10)


“Third, the model can endogenously improve end-use efficiency by investing in more efficient technologies for the conversion of final energies into energy services. For example, three vehicle technologies with different efficiencies are implemented in the light duty vehicle (LDV) mode of the transport sector, including internal combustion engine vehicles, battery-electric vehicles, and fuel cell vehicles.” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 10)

“The balance of demand from the macro-economy and supply from the energy system delivers equilibrium prices at the final energy level.” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 13)
2.3.3 Trade


“trade of coal, gas, oil, biomass, uranium, the composite good (aggregated output of the macro-economic system), and emissions permits”


“renewable energy sources (other than biomass) and secondary energy carriers are non-tradable across regions” (exceptions for electricity accross regions exist for switches)


“While each region is an open system - meaning that it can import more than it exports - the global system is closed” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 13)


“In line with the classical Heckscher-Ohlin and Ricardian models (Heckscher et al. 1991), trade between regions is induced by differences in factor endowments and technologies.” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 13)


“additional possibility of inter-temporal trade. This can be interpreted as capital trade or borrowing and lending.” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 13)


“For each region, the value of exports must balance the value of imports within the time horizon of the model” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 14) (intertemporal budget constraint)


“prices of mobile factors to equalize” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 14)


“Since no capital market distortions are considered, the interest rates equalize across regions” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 14)


“Similarly, permit prices equalize across regions, unless their trade is restricted.” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 14)


“By contrast, final energy prices and wages can differ across regions because these factors are immobile” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 14)


“Prices for traded primary energy carriers differ according to the transportation costs.” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 14)


“The Negishi approach considers the trade balances of all goods explicitly and adjusts the welfare weights in order to guarantee that the intertemporal balance of payments of each region is settled.” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 14)


“The Nash approach adjusts goods prices until demand and supply of traded goods are equalized.” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 14)


Technological change


“The specific investment costs for wind, solar PV, and solar CSP decrease by 12, 20, and 9\%, respectively, for each doubling of cumulated capacity. The capital costs of the generalized storage units for VRE, as well as of advanced vehicle technologies (BEV, FCV), decrease with a 10\% learning rate. REMIND reduces learning rates as capacities increase such that the investment costs asymptotically approach exogenously prescribed floor costs” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 15)


“energy efficiency improvements via an exogenously prescribed increase in the efficiency parameters of the CES production function, as well as price induced reductions in energy demand and changes in technology choice.” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 15)


“REMIND represents investment dynamics in terms of capital motion equations, vintages for energy supply technologies and adjustment costs related to the acceleration of capacity expansion (for further details see Section 3.2).” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 15)


3. Energy


3.1 Energy resource endowments


extraction cost curves for exhaustible resources such as coal, oil, gas, and uranium


Fossil resources are further defined by decline rates and adjustment costs


Extraction costs increase over time as low-cost deposits become exhausted


we use region-specific extraction cost curves that relate production cost increases to cumulative extraction


fossil extraction cost input data are approximated by piecewise linear functions that are employed for fossil resource extraction curves.


Additionally, as a scenario choice, it is possible to make oil and gas extraction cost curves time dependent. This means that resources and costs may increase or decrease over time depending on expected future conditions such as technological and geopolitical changes.”


“For uranium, extraction costs follow a third-order polynomial parameterization. The amount of available uranium is limited to 23 Mt. This resource potential includes reserves, conventional resources, and a conservative estimate of unconventional resources”


“REMIND prescribes decline rates for the extraction of coal, oil, and gas. In the case of oil and gas, these are dynamic extraction constraints based on data published by the International Energy Agency (IEA 2008a; IEA 2009). An additional dynamic constraint limits the extraction growth of coal, oil, and gas to 10\% per year.


In addition, we use adjustment costs to represent short-term price markups resulting from rapid expansion of resource production” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 16)


“Trade costs in REMIND are both region-and resource-specific.” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 17)


“REMIND represents three types of bioenergy feedstocks: (a) First-generation produced from sugar, starch, and oilseeds (typically small in quantity, based on an exogenous scenario); (b) Ligno-cellulosic residues from agriculture and forest; and (c) Second-generation purpose-grown biomass from specialized ligno-cellulosic grassy and woody bioenergy crops, such as miscanthus, poplar, and eucalyptus.”


for supply of purpose-grown bioenergy REMIND draws on an emulation of the land-use model MAgPIE


The emulator describes supply costs and total agricultural emissions as a function of bioenergy demand


To reflect concerns about the sustainability, REMIND assumes an ad valorem tax on bioenergy”


The tax increases linearly from 0 to 100\% between 2030 and 2100 and is applied to the bioenergy price given by the emulator.”


REMIND models resource potentials for non-biomass renewables (hydro, solar, wind, and geothermal) using region-specific potentials.”


For each renewable energy type, we classify the potentials into different grades, specified by capacity factors . Superior grades have higher capacity factors, which correspond to more full-load hours per year. This implies higher energy production for a given installed capacity. Therefore, the grade structure leads to a gradual expansion of renewable energy deployment over time as a result of optimization.”


“The core part of the energy system is the conversion of primary energy into secondary energy carriers via specific energy conversion technologies. Around fifty different energy conversion technologies are represented in REMIND.”


“REMIND specifies each technology through a number of characteristic parameters • Specific overnight investment costs that are constant for most technologies and decrease due to learning-by-doing for some relatively new technologies (see below). • Cost markups due to financing costs over the construction time. • Fixed yearly operating and maintenance costs in percent of investment costs. • Variable operating costs (per unit of output, excluding fuel costs). • Conversion efficiency from input to output. • Capacity factor (aaximum utilization time per year). This parameter also reflects maintenance periods and other technological limitations that prevent the continuous operation of the technology. • Technical lifetime of the conversion technology in years. • If the technology experiences learning-by-doing: initial learn rate, initial cumulative capacity, as well as floor costs that can only be approached asymptotically.


no hard constraints on the rate of change in investments -{\textgreater}  high flexibility for technological evolution.





includes cost mark-ups for the fast up-scaling of investments into individual technologies; therefore, a more realistic phasing in and out of technologies is achieved.


model allows for pre-mature retirement of capacities before the end of their technological life-time (at a maximum rate of 4 \%/year), and the lifetimes of capacities differ between various types of technologies.”


Each region is initialized with a vintage capital stock and conversion efficiencies are calibrated to reflect the input-output relations provided by IEA energy statistics” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 21)


The conversion efficiencies for new vintages converge across the regions from the 2005 values to a global constant value in 2050


for some fossil power plants, transformation efficiencies improve exogenously over time.


REMIND adjusts by-production coefficients of combined power-heat technologies (CHP) by region to meet the empirical conditions of the base year.


Only one technology converts secondary energy into secondary energy, which is the production of hydrogen from electricity via electrolysis” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 21)

“REMIND represents electricity/gas/hydrogen grids as well as distribution costs for solids and liquids in terms of linear cost-markups on final energy use” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 24)


“The approach used in REMIND follows the idea that storage demands for each VRE type rise with increasing market share. This is because balancing fluctuations becomes ever more Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=269707” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 24)
“Description of the REMIND model (version 1.6) Page {\textbar} 25 challenging with higher penetration” 


“For modeling reasons, there is a “generalized storage unit”, tailor-made for each VRE. This construct consists of a VRE-specific mix of short- and medium-term storage as well as curtailment.” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 25)


“A specific combination of real-world storage options is determined in order to match the VRE-specific fluctuation pattern. From this combination of actual storage technologies, we calculate aggregated capital costs and efficiency parameters for the “generalized storage unit” of a specific VRE.” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 25)


“To calculate the total storage costs and losses at each point in time, the calculated “generalized storage unit” of a VRE is scaled with this VRE’s scale-factor α (= electricity produced from this VRE* market shareVRE). The capital costs of the generalized storage units decrease through learning-by-doing with a 10\% learning rate.” (per year?)


“Costs for long-term HVDC transmission are included following a similar logic as storage costs.” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 25)


“Both storage and grid requirements are partly regionalized” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 25)


“in regions where high demand coincides with high wind (EUR) or solar (USA, ROW, AFR, IND, MEA) incidence, storage requirements are slightly reduced. If a region is small or has homogeneously distributed VRE potentials (EUR, USA, IND, JPN), grid requirements are lower” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 25)


-{\textgreater} Is grid quality accounted for somewhere??


“CCS technologies exist for generating electricity as well as for the production of liquid fuels, gases, and hydrogen from coal.” 


“There are regional constraints on CO2 storage potentials which are largely based on IEA (2008b).


 In total, the global storage potential amounts to around 1000 GtC . It is smaller for EUR with 50 GtC, Japan with 20 GtC, and India with 50 GtC. The yearly injection rate of CO2 is assumed not to exceed 0.5\% of total storage capacity due to technical and geological co” 


3.3 Transpoirt


“combining top-down and bottom-up element” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 26)


“mobility demands for the four modeled transport sub-sectors (passenger-light duty vehicles (LDV), freight, electric rail, passengeraviation and buses) are derived in a top-down fashion, since they are input to a nested CES production function that ultimately produces GDP.” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 26)


“The transport sector requires input of final energy in different forms (liquids, electricity and hydrogen) and requires investments and operation and maintenance payments into the distribution infrastructure (infrastructure capacity grows linearly with distributed final energy) as well as into the vehicle stock” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 26)


“It generates emissions that go into the climate model and, depending on the scenario, can be taxed or limited by a budget. Furthermore, it is possible to consider taxes and subsidies on fuels.” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 26)


“Material needs and embodied energy are not considered” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 26)


“The main drivers/determinants of transport demand are GDP growth, the autonomous efficiency improvements (efficiency parameters of CES production function), and the elasticities of substitution between capital and energy and between stationary and transport energy forms.” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 26)


“Efficiency, lifetime, investment costs, and fixed O\&M costs parameters characterize all vehicle technologies. All these parameters, except investment costs for battery electric and fuel cell vehicles, are constant over time.” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 27)


“Fuel prices are fully endogenous, as determined by the supply sector (intertemporal optimization with resource and capacity constraints as well as prices/constraints on emissions in policy scenarios)” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 27)
Land-Use


“By default, REMIND relies on reduced-form approaches to account for these inter-linkages between the energy and the agricultural and land-use sectors (stand-alone mode). These are derived based on the state-of-the-art land use model MAgPIE” 


“or a detailed and fully consistent analysis of the integrated energy-economy-land use system, REMIND can also be soft-linked and run iteratively with MAgPIE” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 29)


“The soft-link between REMIND and MAgPIE focuses on two crucial interactions: (i) bioenergy demand and supply, (ii) land use/land use change emissions and GHG prices. At the end-point of the iterative solution process, the markets for bioenergy and emission mitigation across the energy and land-use sector are in equilibrium.” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 29)


“REMIND derives non-CO2 emissions in the absence of climate policies from various agricultural activities for given assumptions on socio-economic pathways from corresponding MAgPIE scenarios. Unless coupled with MAgPIE, we use marginal abatement cost curves from Lucas et al. (2007) to derive economic abatement potentials.” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 30)


5 Climate module


GHGs: “For each fuel, region and technology, REMIND applies specific emissions factors, which are calibrated to match base year GHG inventories (EDGAR 2011).” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 31)


“Emissions from international shipping and aviation and waste of all species are exogenous and taken from Fujino et al. (2006).” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 34)


“By default, REMIND is coupled with the MAGICC 6 climate model to translate emissions into changes in atmospheric composition, radiative forcing and temperature increase.” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 34)


“In addition, REMIND includes a reduced-form climate model similar to the one used in DICE (Nordhaus and Boyer 2000) which can be used within the REMIND optimization to enable direct formulation of temperature or radiative forcing targets in climate mitigation scenarios.” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 34)


6 Key strenghts and caveat
strenghts


“can fully capture the interactions between economic development, trade, and climate mitigation policies.” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 35)


“The full macro-economic integration is particularly valuable for the assessment of the regional distribution of mitigation costs” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 35)


“ability to calculate first -best mitigation strategies that provide benchmark development pathways against which mitigation scenarios under suboptimal settings can be compared.” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 35)


full where flexibility (trade of goods and emission permits)


full when flexibility (intertemporal optimization of welfare-optimizing emissions reductions trajectory”


full what flexibility: 


weaknesses:


“simultaneous solution of the macro -economy and the energy system, as well as inter-temporal optimization, the computational effort for solving REMIND is very high.” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 35). “The level of computational complexity limits the amount of detail in the model. I” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 35)


“The spatial resolution of the model is limited to 12 world regions. Many relevant subscale processes—particularly in terms of infrastructure for power grids, transportation, pipelines, etc.—are not resolved explicitly.” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 35)


“Trading of composite goods is a free, unrestricted variable. The emerging trade pattern shows trade flows from “North” to “South” in the base year 2005. While this is in accordance with the theory, it contrasts the empirics in some regions (particularly China and USA).” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 35). “To correct this, it is necessary to calibrate regionally differentiated time preference rates (Leimbach et al. 2014). The limitations in reproducing trade patterns in non-energy goods only has a limited influence on climate policy analyses because it applies to baseline and climate policy scenarios alike.” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 35)


“Electricity from renewables such as wind and solar is characterized by strong fluctuations of supply in time and space . Representation of the challenges associated with the integration of variable renewable energies only occurs at an aggregated level” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 35)


“The representation of final energy demand lacks detail on the level of energy-consuming activities and technologies. Consequently, representation of inertias from significant turnover rates for end-use equipment in some sectors, climate policy -relevant feedbacks from knowledge accumulation as well as technological spillovers and consumer choice of technologies only occurs in a stylized manner.” (Luderer et al., 2015, p. 36)

The European Commission subsequently refocused policymaking toward integrating climate objectives into other policy areas such as energy and the 2014-2020 European Union (EU) budget. The conditions for successful climate policy integration (CPI) are analyzed, focusing on the compatibility of key actors' beliefs. In renewable energy policy, CPI was successful as long as the co-benefits and related policy-core beliefs of energy security, rural economic development and climate action coexisted harmoniously. Once conflict among these policy-core beliefs emerged during the biofuels controversy, CPI was weakened as actors with competing economy-focused beliefs controlled the decision-making process. The case of EU budget climate mainstreaming illustrates how actors can add climate objectives into legislation despite meaningful discussion being 'crowded out' by other priorities. The findings highlight the importance of low conflict between departments, compatible beliefs and policy priorities for successful CPI.},

	abstract = {Carbon pricing is widely recognized as the most economically efficient policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, its high-cost visibility creates political challenges for its implementation at a sufficiently stringent level to achieve deep decarbonization. Flexible regulations, such as renewable portfolio standards and low-carbon fuels standards, incorporate flexibility mechanisms similar to carbon pricing, but seem to face lessor political acceptability barriers. Unlike prescriptive (command-and-control) regulations, flexible regulations do not require technologically-specific compliance pathways and allow credit trading to reduce costs and incentivize innovation. Despite their potential for driving the decarbonization transition, there is comparatively little research on the design and impact of flexible regulations implemented to date. This comparative policy analysis examines government policy documents and academic literature to identify flexible climate regulations implemented in OECD countries and evaluates their implementation context, design characteristics, effectiveness, and public support. In total, 61 unique flexible regulations were identified across 11 countries and 42 sub-national jurisdictions that can be classified into six categories. Findings suggest that as jurisdictions seek to strengthen their climate policy portfolios, flexible regulations can provide a relatively cost effective, broadly supported, and complementary tool to achieve deep emissions reductions, so long as policies are well-designed and interaction and equity impacts are considered.},

This study chronologically reviewed the previous development and adopted pertinent policies determine the feasibility of deploying methanol vehicles from national to provincial levels. Based on the analysis and evaluations, the local government is suggested to make the following dynamic policy recommendations: (a) Before reaching the "carbon peak", development strategies should be formulated according to the resource situation of each region. Priority should be given to the deployment of coal-to-methanol vehicles and bio-methanol vehicles to maximize the economy, so as to promote the construction of transmission and distribution systems, advance the manufacturing process of methanol fuel, and prepare the technology for the next stage.

Moreover, the current status of renewable energy development in two countries is summarized. From the study, it can be concluded both countries have set a Renewable Energy Target and promulgated legislation and regulations to enlarge the scale of renewable energy; China shows a stronger commitment to renewable energy than Australia. However, Renewable Energy Certificate mechanism is implemented more effectively in Australia than in China. The paper suggests: augmenting and rebuilding the electricity network and strengthening coordination between different levels of governments for both countries; enhancing manufacturing facilities and incentives for the solar and wind industry for Australia, while developing more-detailed implementation legislation and renewable power quota system for China.

The outcomes of this work will provide useful information for policy design, monitoring and evaluation in these countries and in other regions, currently developing appropriate emission control measures.

	doi = {10.1016/j.erss.2019.101411},
	abstract = {Policy is an important driver for the deployment of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). Most PEV policy research focuses on effectiveness in the short-term, even though policymakers i) typically consider a wider range of evaluation criteria and ii) are setting PEV sales goals in the longer-term (e.g., 2030 or 2040). This study develops a more comprehensive evaluation framework, considering five criteria: (i) effectiveness at increasing PEV adoption in the long-term (2040), (ii) government spending, (iii) public support, (iv) policy simplicity and (v) "transformational signal", the latter being a measure of a policy's ability to stimulate confidence and investment in a PEV transition. We apply this framework to Canada by assessing eight policy types implemented across the country, as well as stronger versions of each policy. We also illustrate trade-offs by constructing three policy packages with similar effectiveness (i.e., PEVs making up 40\% of light-duty vehicle sales by 2040). These packages include strong financial incentives (\$6,000 CAD per PEV for 20 years), a Zero-Emissions Vehicle (ZEV) sales mandate (requiring 40\% PEV sales by 2040), or strengthened light-duty vehicle emissions standards (decreasing to 71 g CO(2)e per km by 2040). These packages differ in terms of government expenditure, policy simplicity, public support and transformative signal. Our framework provides an accessible tool for policymakers to assess such tradeoffs with PEV-supportive policies and to identify approaches that best suit their jurisdiction.},

The adoption rate of electric vehicles in Sweden is however relatively slow and varies substantially across municipalities. This study empirically examines the impact of local policy instruments designed to promote the adoption of electric vehicles. We use panel data between 2010 and 2016 to estimate the effect of local policy instruments on the share of newly registered battery electric vehicles in Swedish municipalities. We find that an increased number of public charging points increases the adoption rate, especially in urban municipalities. The results further suggest that public procurement of battery electric vehicles has the potential to be an effective policy instrument. Finally, we find that by adjusting policy instruments to the specific characteristics of municipalities and making them visible to the public, their effectiveness can be increased. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

The paper concentrates on the role of policy and organisational structure to contribute and push the solar energy into practice. The analysis of those factors is a key main of the study to understand the linkage of the solar energy and the development. In this regard, the study and analysis of solar energy expansion in India and China are based on the primary data such as the government documentary. Secondary sources such as the information from the international organisation, book, journal, etc. have also been used. The relation between the solar energy and the development in India and China can be understood in terms of energy security and the accessibility to electricity. In fact, the policy implementation of both countries reflects the different result in the action. China has made significant progress in the use of solar energy for national development through employment and increased access to electricity. The different outcomes of both countries are due to the goal and R\&D investment, policy, and organisational structure factors driving solar energy development.

This paper uses statistical information from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the International Energy Agency (IEA), British Petroleum (BP), and the Renewable Energy Network (REN21), and peer-reviewed sources. The research methodology includes analytical research and evaluation methods to examine the current state of solar energy policy, its motivators and incentives, as well as the prospects for its development in Kazakhstan and in the world. Research shows that solar energy has a huge development potential worldwide and is sure to take its place in gross electricity production. This paper focuses on the selected economic policies of the top five countries and Kazakhstan, in what may be considered a specific research limitation. Future research suggestions for the expansion of Renewable Energy (RE) in Kazakhstan could include analysing the impact of introducing dedicated policies and incentives for solar systems and exploring the benefits and challenges of implementing large RE zones with government-business collaboration.},

	abstract = {Morocco has become known for being an example of a well-performing utility-led rural electrification program, but so far little independent research has scrutinized this extraordinary case. Based on a critical review of the available literature, this study attempts to draw a picture of the evolution of rural electrification in Morocco, the policies and programs that have been implemented, and their institutional, technical, and financial dimensions. The review reveals that information available about the success of the programme has almost entirely been provided by the utility ONE, which has strategic and commercial interests in showing its achievements in a favorable light. With this in mind, three main principles are identified as having contributed to the rapid evolution of levels of electrification: (1) a clear vision and a continuing political commitment to follow the plan; (2) an institutional framework that brings into action the strength of the utility and of both national and international actors; and (3) a finance model that includes all stakeholders and international financial institutions. However, three factors may have been equally important in achieving these results: (1) a level of rural electrification in Morocco that from the outset was far below that in comparable neighboring countries; (2) a high GDP compared to sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries; and (3) a high level of urban electrification that allowed cross-subsidization from urban consumers. So while the Moroccan case is inspiring for SSA countries, we need to be prudent before we relate the rapid increase in electrification to the implementation model alone.

To better support effective policy making, we conducted a comparative case study to investigate how the choice of policy bundles has led to the cross national variation in smart meter deployment in Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands. We found that countries with a combination of policy measures that address multiple barriers to smart meters tend to be leaders, while laggards often overlook or fail to adopt policies to overcome key barriers. This research builds on technology diffusion and policy impact assessment literature and provides valuable insights on the design of effective policy tools to promote clean energy innovations.

	abstract = {Low-carbon city development plays a critical role in the sustainable development of a country, especially to those new emerging economies such as China. The Chinese government recognizes the leading role of national policy system in facilitating the low-carbon city development. Meanwhile, positive effects are derived from the implementation of national policies. This study critically analyzed various policies promulgated during 2010-2019 by the Chinese government. A multi-dimensional framework is developed in this study to better understand the policies related to low carbon city development in China. These state-level policies are classified into six aspects: planning guidance, building energy conservation, industrial development regulation, energy industry development and energy mix, economic measures, and supervision measures. The evolution of these policies is examined in this study. Results show that national policies play a significant role in guiding low-carbon development of cities while the practicability of these national policies is improved. In addition, the development of low carbon city clusters is actively promoted by the Chinese government and linked to other strategic initiatives such as "The Belt and Road". These findings help to better understand the national policy landscape of low carbon city development in China, as well as providing useful references to the policy making in other countries.

While EV-Carsharing has been launching in more than 10 cities by end of 2014, Central Governments will select 4 as demonstration cities from 2015 and give special support to help them integrate EV-Carsharing into urban E-mobility more successfully. Recognizing importance and benefit for energy conservation, emission and traffic congestion reduction from EV-Carsharing, encouraged by Central Governments and pilot cities, more and more cities are preparing for EV-Carsharing to develop local EV industry and expand usage for urban E-mobility. This report is based on deep understanding of Chinese EV Pilot City as the biggest background for EVCarsharing's boom in China in past 2 years. Through conducting comparative studies, field investigation, survey, expert interview, data collection and analysis, this report comprehensively summarizes latest status of EV-Carsharing in China and some typical practice in different cities and highlights successful experience as well as barriers on key dimensions for EV-Carsharing, including application of telematics on EVs, Governments' policy and administration, business and operating models, safety and security system and consumers' education. Suggestions and guidelines will also be provided with recommendations on operating successful EV-Carsharing for urban E-mobility and better low carbon society for both China and other areas. © 2015 WEVA.},

	abstract = {Many countries are in the process of deregulating and restructuring their electric power industries. Although the introduction of retail competition may have negative impacts on the development of renewable energy, a number of countries are establishing new programs to support these clean energy technologies. In the United States, debate has centered on three primary renewables support mechanisms: (1) the renewables portfolio standard; (2) programs funded by an electricity distribution surcharge; and (3) voluntary renewable energy purchases by electricity customers via green power marketing. California provides a good case study of the design of renewables support programs within industry restructuring because policymakers considered all three of these options during the state's restructuring proceedings. Moreover, many of the same policy options, design issues, and political conflicts that have arisen in California are likely to recur in other states and countries. Some of the most important lessons from the California experience include: (1) renewable energy and environmental advocates must clearly articulate the need and rationale for continued support of renewables; (2) cost containment and competitive neutrality concerns must be addressed head on; (3) combinations of policies are likely to be far more effective than any single renewables policy; and (4) the effectiveness of renewable energy policies developed during the restructuring process will be strongly linked to their duration and stability.

This paper uses a very stylized transport model for the greater Oslo area to give insights into the effects of different transport policies. With this model we go beyond the market penetration studies for EVs, as it brings together both car choice and transport patterns with mode choice for a set of heterogeneous representative model agents. We illustrate the possible effects of current policies on congestion, CO2 emissions and other urban transport externalities, public transport use and crowding, tax revenues and welfare. On this basis, we explore other road toll, public transport fare and tax policies that can lead to better outcomes for the Oslo transport market while still respecting the CO2-cap that reflects the goals of Norwegian policy makers.},

	volume = {8},
	doi = {10.1007/s40974-022-00261-6},
	abstract = {The energy transition is progressing slowly in the ten member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). To achieve ASEAN’s target of 23\% renewables in the primary energy supply by 2025, the region would need to invest USD 27 billion in renewable energy every year. However, the ASEAN countries attracted no more than USD 8 billion annually from 2016 to 2021. Through a comparative review of three key factors for attracting investment—renewable energy legislation, energy governance reform, and general conditions for investors—this study examines why the region’s renewable energy sector has not attracted more capital. The contribution of the article is threefold. First, it develops a new review model for assessing the business climate for renewable energy in any country. Second, it offers an update on the state of renewable energy deployment in the ASEAN countries. Third, taking into account international best practices, it identifies the obstacles and solutions to attracting investment in renewable energy in Southeast Asia. The article finds that carbon lock-in is pervasive, regulatory practices have been copy-pasted from the fossil-fuel sector to the renewables sector, and, except for Malaysia and Vietnam, no ASEAN country has implemented a major pro-renewable energy governance reform. Certain advanced renewable energy measures, such as auctions and feed-in tariffs, have been adopted in some member states, but the institutional capacity to implement them is limited. The share of renewables in the energy governance system needs to be increased. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Renewable Energy (RE) has been identified as a key tool to counter climate change and enhance energy security. Countries across the globe have been promoting this sector by several policy measures. However, limited research has been undertaken on the economic and environmental efficacy of RE policy instruments, especially in context of emerging economies like India, which have witnessed substantial capacity addition and have set ambitious targets to de-carbonize their economy. This paper identifies 25 innovative practices followed in India which have enabled accelerated RE capacity addition with minimal financial obligations. These include energy entrepreneurship, energy democratization, private sector participation, hedging and apportioning RE procurement, use of auctions with stringent participatory norms, creditworthy counter-party, leverage of risk capital by developmental institutions, regular revision of tariffs, environmental cess on polluting industries, long-term RE purchase trajectory and incentivizing green power output. Results indicate high financial impact of instruments (support of US\$ 3-5/MW h over applicable tariff) which gets neutralized when tax inflow is considered. Lower carbon abatement cost (US\$ 3-6/tCO2eq) depicts high environmental efficacy. The paper shares best practices from India in terms of efficient use of RE policy enablers, which may be contextualized in other emerging economies as per the local requirements.

Despite the efforts of other nations, the role of China in the global phase-out of coal power remains crucial. Our study with a sub-national focus sheds important new light on the drivers and decision-making dynamics of exiting of coal power use in China. Based on a case study of closures of coal power plants in China's Guangdong province, we find that under certain circumstances, governments - especially those in the provincial and city levels - can and do act as change agents when it comes to retirement of coal fired power stations. Our study reveals a number of push and pull mechanisms that governments have utilized to overcome the resistance of incumbent power generation companies, primarily based on developmental considerations. By identifying the drivers and enabling mechanisms of phasing out the use of coal power in a significant sub-national region in China, our study contributes to both of the sustainability transition literature and the energy policy literature.},

	abstract = {China's high-speed economic growth and ambitious urbanization depend heavily on the massive consumption of fossil fuel. However, the over-dependence on the depleting fossil fuels causes severe environmental problems, making China the largest energy consumer and the biggest CO2 emitter in the world. Faced with significant challenges in terms of managing its environment and moving forward with the concept of sustainable economic development, the Chinese government plans to move away from fossil fuels and rely on renewables such as hydropower, wind power, solar power, biomass power and nuclear power. In this paper, the current status of China's renewable energy deployment and the ongoing development projects are summarized and discussed. Most recent developments of major renewable energy sources are clearly reviewed. Additionally, the renewable energy development policies including laws and regulations, economic encouragement, technical research and development are also summarized. This study showcases China's achievements in exploiting its abundant domestic renewable energy sources to meet the future energy demand and reducing carbon emissions. To move toward a low carbon society, technological progress and policy improvements are needed for improving grid access (wind), securing nuclear fuel supplies and managing safety protocols (nuclear), integrating supply chains to achieve indigenous manufacture of technologies across supply chains (solar). Beyond that, a preliminary prediction of the development of China's future renewable energy developments, and proposes targeted countermeasures and suggestions are proposed. The proposal involves developing smart-grid system, investing on renewable energy research, improving the feed-in tariff system and clarifying the subsidy system.},

	abstract = {This article summarizes lessons learnt from 15 case studies on the political economy of coal following one integrated framework. It proposes four country categories that show comparable properties to analyze the political economy of coal, including countries that i) phase out coal, ii) phase in coal, iii) are established users and iv) depend on coal exports. Regarding the prevalence of coal investments in many countries, it highlights the role of conflicting societal objectives, e.g. affordable electricity prices being more important than environmental targets. Vested interests are mainly related to locally concentrated job losses, expectations regarding regional development, coal royalties, as well as lobbying by a politically well-connected coal industry. Those factors can be either strengthened or extenuated by structural factors, including multi-level governance issues and the structure of the energy market. Entry points for policy vary for different country categories. De-risking financing of alternatives to coal as well as reforms of energy markets are most important entry points in countries that still invest in coal or plan to phase in coal to their energy systems.},

	abstract = {The dependence of cities on intensive energy consumption is a major cause of climate disruption, and there is increasing interest in the potential for many cities to facilitate a transition to sustainable energy utilization. This study, taking Macau as a case study, reviewed its energy consumption and the efforts that have been made to promote the building of a sustainable energy-efficient city. The results revealed that energy consumption in Macau has increased steadily over the past twenty-five years from 16,295 TJ in 1990 to 34,612 TJ in 2015. In order to improve energy efficiency, the Macau government enacted some effective policies and guidance, and also launched some energy-saving publicity campaigns. Survey results showed that both Macau residents and the commercial sector had good energy-saving awareness, and that energy-saving behaviors were very common. There has been a consequent reduction in unit energy consumption in Macau: the energy consumption per capita declined from a peak value 67.20 GJ in 2005 to 53.23 GJ in 2015. The two keys for achieving a sustainable energy-efficient city energy efficiency in buildings and in the transportation system have also been greatly improved. The unit energy consumption of office buildings decreased from 56.7 MJ/m(2)/year in 2005 to 36.3 MJ/m(2)/year in 2013. Improving and promoting public transit has been the main approach to attaining transportation energy efficiency in Macau. In addition, electricity generation from waste incineration has become an important electricity source in Macau, accounting for 17.4\% of the local electricity generation in 2015. Macau has chosen roof-top solar technology as the most effective way to utilize solar energy, as a 1-m(2) solar panel can generate about 167 kWh of electricity annually. It is hoped that this study can provide useful information to help Macau, as well as other cities, to become a sustainable energy-efficient city.},

Their implementation involves restructuring the existing energy system and requires appropriate policy support and sufficient investment in infrastructure development and technological innovation. Some basic principles and countermeasures that have already been implemented by some major emitters, such as India and China, are also discussed, with different transformation pathways. Critical suggestions are also provided, such as implementing best practice policies at the national level, moving to more efficient transition strategies, national and regional cooperation, cross-border energy grid integration, and private sector involvement to reduce carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants, not only by reducing coal consumption but also by introducing various low carbon technologies. © 2021},

We apply a qualitative assessment of policies and difference-in-differences to evaluate the effects of particular regulations. We find that policymakers in Poland did not identify households as stakeholders in their strategies since starting the energy transformation back in the 1990s until the early 2020s. We demonstrate that the government policies failed to stimulate efficient decarbonisation of the residential sector and did not address such issues as energy poverty and air pollution, while the coal consumption rates by Polish households remained the highest in the European Union. The situation has started to change since 2017 when the first regions in Poland introduced anti-smog regulations, which have had a minor, yet positive effect on air quality and the decrease in the number of coal stoves. Furthermore, "Clean air" and "My electricity" programmes were introduced in 2018 and 2019, which provided subsidies for investments in clean heating technologies, and small-scale photovoltaics. These support instruments have yielded relatively positive results. Finally, the Polish energy policy of 2021 identified decarbonisation in the residential sector, reducing energy poverty and improving air quality as key priorities.},

	abstract = {India's ambitious goals for renewable energy raise many questions regarding the nature of investment required. We conduct financial modeling of actual renewable projects in India; and derive the following insights. First, the high cost of debt is the most pressing problem: higher cost and inferior terms of debt in India may raise the cost of renewable energy by 24-32\% compared to the U.S. Second, even if cost of debt goes down, loan terms - including short tenors and variable interest rates - will become significant impediments, given that they add 13-14\% to the cost of renewable energy in India compared to the U.S. Finally, due to the high cost of debt, policy lessons from the U.S. and Europe; which focus on finer instruments such as duration of revenue-support, revenue-certainty, investor-risk-perception, and completion/cost-certainty; are not likely to be as effective, with potential impacts on the cost of renewable energy in the 3-11\% range. In fact, we find that an interest-rate subsidy, which reduces the cost of debt, reduces the overall subsidy burden by 13-16\%. This suggests that Indian policymakers need to prioritize the provision of low-cost, long-term debt and take a closer look at the successful efforts by China and Brazil. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A separate reform is necessary in order to meet the ever-increasing need for environmentally friendly energy sources, with a particular emphasis on specialised sources such as hydrogen. The purpose of this article is to provide an analysis and evaluation of the most important aspects of India’s Green Hydrogen Policy 2022, as well as the current situation in the Indian Power Sector, with a particular focus on the integration of clean sources of power generation with conventional sources. The assessment also includes an analysis of global regulations in the hydrogen area, an evaluation of best practises, and a forecast of the role that investments by eco-system stakeholders will play in helping to make it effective. © 2023, Central Board of Irrigation and Power.

	abstract = {Heating and cooling in the industrial, commercial, and domestic sectors constitute around 40-50\% of total global final energy demand. A wide range of renewable energy heating and cooling (REHC) technologies exists but they are presently only used to meet around 2-3\% of total world demand (excluding from traditional biomass). Several of these technologies are mature, their markets are growing, and their costs relative to conventional heating and cooling systems continue to decline. However, in most countries, policies developed to encourage the wider deployment of renewable electricity generation, transport biofuels and energy efficiency have over-shadowed policies aimed at REHC technology deployment. This paper, based on the findings of the International Energy Agency publication Renewables for Heating and Cooling-Untapped Potential, outlines the present and future markets and compares the costs of providing heating and cooling services from solar, geothermal and biomass resources. It analyses current policies and experiences and makes recommendations to support enhanced market deployment of REHC technologies to provide greater energy supply security and climate change mitigation. If policies as successfully implemented by the leading countries were to be replicated elsewhere (possibly after modification to better suit local conditions), there would be good potential to significantly increase the share of renewable energy in providing heating and cooling services.

	abstract = {It is crucial to understand the dynamics of phase-outs of non-sustainable energy carriers to accelerate the decarbonization of the economy in hindsight of the climate crisis. Taking the German example, the exit of nuclear energy as a successful policy is compared to the phase-out process of coal power to provide new insights on such policy change. The historical pathway of each phase-out policy is examined as the basis for the comparison. In general, the German nuclear phase-out is driven by a strong anti-nuclear sentiment in the public and as a political strategy whereas for the exit of coal the socio-ecological movement, a severe drought in 2018 and a deep institutional academic and non-academic knowledge transfer for the climate crisis were the main drivers. The examination together with the deductive thematic analysis enables then to identify commonalities and differ-ences of the two phase-out policies that manifest themselves in the following dimensions: institutionalization, visibility of impacts, public image, and incumbency. The ethics committee of the German nuclear phase-out in 2011 was a pivotal institutionalized actor in fostering the final exit. Its reasoning resonated in the public delightfully as it changed nuclear powers image and provided the argumentative pathway for the then chancellor Merkel to turn around her energy politics. Based on the acquired learnings, a convocation of an ethics committee to evaluate the moral implications of the climate crisis is able to foster the acceleration of future fossil fuel phase-outs.},

This article explains variation among Canadian cities regarding policies adopted to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with a particular focus on green building standards. By applying insights from the study of the politics of public policy to urban politics, this article finds that while electoral disincentives prevent most cities from enacting high impact green building policies, the success of some cities can be attributed to the influence of independent municipal environment departments. These departments facilitate policy learning by providing information and resources. The findings suggest that policy makers could improve the effectiveness of local climate change policy by creating municipal environment departments that have organizational capacity-funding, staff, and a cross-cutting mandate-and are insulated from interference from politicians and line departments.},

Research shows that women tend to exhibit more knowledge about climate change, environmental concerns, and pro-environmental behaviour than men. Theories linking descriptive and substantive representation suggest that women representatives better represent women citizens' policy preferences. Therefore, do higher levels of women's parliamentary participation increase renewable energy consumption? A time-series cross-sectional analysis of 100 democracies from 1997 to 2017 provides evidence for such a relationship in both high- and middle-income democracies. Lagged modelling demonstrates that high-income states see more immediate effects while they take longer to materialize in middle-income states. These findings contribute to our growing understanding of women's role in policymaking outside of 'women's issues' and offer a means of advancing climate-friendly energy policy.},

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology takes up a promising position in the achievement of a low-carbon future. Currently, CCS projects are implemented not only for CO2 storage but also for its usage in industries, in conformity with the principles of a circular economy. To date, a number of countries have accumulated experience in launching and implementing CCS projects. At the same time, the peculiarities and pace of technology development around the world remain different. This paper attempts to identify key factors that, first, generally affect CCS projects deployment, and second, create favorable conditions for CCS technologies development. Based on an extensive literature review and the experience of different countries, classification and interpretation of these factors are offered, justifying their impact on CCS projects. As a result of this paper, the authors present an assessment of the maturity of policy incentives and regulations in the field of CCS for different countries with revealed dependence between the level and effectiveness of CCS projects' implementation, confirming the adequacy of the offered approaches and identifying measures that ensure success in CCS. The methodology of this study includes case studies, a modified PEST analysis, system-oriented analysis, the checklist method, and regression analyses.},

In many countries local authorities play an important role in the local development, but renewable energy deployment is not an obligatory task for them. Hence there are two research questions: (1) Do local governments think investments in renewable energy (RE) are urgent and affordable within the local budgets? (2) How do they react to the public aid co-financing investments in renewable energy? To provide the answer we performed qualitative analysis and non-parametric tests of data from a survey of 252 local authorities, analysis of 292 strategies of local development and datasets of 1170 renewable energy projects co-financed by EU funds under operational programs 2007-2013 and 2014-2020 in Poland. Findings showed that local authorities' attitudes were rather careful, caused by financial constraints of local budgets and the scope of obligatory tasks, which made renewable energy investments not the most urgent. Public aid was a factor significantly affecting local authorities' behavior. It triggered local authorities' renewable energy initiatives, increasing the number and scope of renewable energy investments as well cooperation with other municipalities and local communities. Despite this general trend, there were also considerable regional differences in local authorities' renewable energy behavior.},

	abstract = {There are numerous strategies to lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or to mitigate global climate change. One of them is to promote polices for developing renewable energy sources. There has been a growth in such policies but not enough is known about their effectiveness. We use a revised version of Schaffrin et al.'s (2015) Index of Policy Activity (IPA)' to examine the historical development (1998-2015) of federal and state/provincial renewable energy policies across five federal countries in the Americas: Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and the United States. Here the focus is on "policy output," which is defined as a function of policy density and intensity. Policy density is measured by counting the number of policies in each country relating to a particular goal during our time frame, while policy intensity, or the strength the policy has toward meeting specific goals, is measured by summing scores for six indicators: objective, scope, integration, budget, implementation and monitoring. The higher the policy score for a country, the more likely the country will be able to meet its intended goals. Our results show that the U.S. has the densest renewable energy policy output followed by Canada, Mexico, Brazil, and finally Argentina has the least-dense policy output. Overall, Brazil and Canada's renewable energy policies were the most intense, followed by Argentina's and the U.S.'s, with Mexico's policies receiving the lowest intensity scores. These countries differ in how long they have supported renewable energy policies and the levels of government that implement them. These findings show that countries may be spending resources on producing myriad renewable energy policies, but without coordination between different levels of government or a concerted effort to ensure that the policy instruments are effective, those resources may be wasted while GHGs continue to rise. This research contributes to the understanding of how individual federal and state/provincial government make efforts toward implementing or enforcing energy policies to influence long-term policy change.},

Public views on climate policy, renewable energy, and low-carbon technologies are explored using focus groups we conducted in Aberdeen, Peterhead, and Edinburgh and citizens' juries in Aberdeen and Edinburgh. The deliberative processes reveal strong public support for continued diversification of Scotland's energy portfolio to include more renewable energy sources, particularly at the local level. We also found support for increased state involvement in the energy sector. Pro-renewables sentiments and skepticism of industry pervade even in Aberdeen, the main oil and gas hub, alongside support for further exploration of low-carbon emission technologies such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) that retain the ability to continue to use fossil fuels. Although Peterhead stood to benefit from a major CCS project, there was remarkably little awareness of the proposed project among residents. Finally, we argue deliberative processes can help both policy-makers and developers gauge where they can (and cannot) expect support.},

Drawing on case studies from the United States, the article suggests that the automated communications enabled by smart grid technologies significantly benefit each dimension of the energy trilemma: economic, social and environmental. However, successful smart grid implementation requires smart communication beyond technology. Failure to engage with customers through targeted communication, or to adequately address customers' privacy concerns, risks alienating customers, threatening the value of the smart grid investment. This article concludes that, with smart communication, both technical and human, the smart grid is an important step towards a sustainable energy future for stakeholders well beyond the United States.},

Generally, other societal actors are the least influential. Economic growth, electricity system stability and low electricity costs are very relevant objectives the major arguments of pro-coal actors. The most relevant contextual factors are the influence of the power sector and structure of the power market.

	abstract = {As a consequence of increasing air pollution, the European Commission has decided to introduce special directives laying down the measures to achieve climate and energy neutrality. Renewable energy (RE) sources play an important role in the pursuit of these goals, which has been taken into account in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The aim of this article is to describe patterns and trends in the achievements of the energy policy of European Union (EU) countries in the field of renewable energy in sustainable development. The identification of leaders in this field gives the possibility to analyse actions taken by the governments of these countries and the possible implementation of the introduced solutions on the ground of individual Member States at the regional and national levels. At the beginning Main goal of energy policy on the field of renewable energy sources (RES) is to increase production from environmentally friendly sources that is why trends were determined in order to assess the rate of achievement of the national target for changes the share of energy from renewable sources in total gross energy consumption. Groups of similar countries were then identified on the basis of three indicators corresponding to the targets set in the climate and energy package. In the group of analysed countries, 14 have achieved the 2020 targets and 4 have exceeded the 2030 targets. The main renewable energy sources (RES) are biofuels, wind, and hydropower. In the assessment of the achievement of energy policy targets, the best situation was observed in the case of Denmark, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. These countries have significantly increased the share of renewable energy in total energy consumption. Compared to other EU countries, they have reduced the economy's energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions the most.},

	abstract = {This article analyses the European petroleum industry's climate engagement over the two first decades of this century. It studies strategic visions and business models, alongside revenue streams and investment patterns, in the five largest European petroleum companies. The analysis shows how the European petroleum majors, starting from 'climate negligence', gradually moved into 'clean petroleum' and ended up with visions of 'net zero' transition out of oil and gas, while revenue streams remained almost exclusively petroleum-based. It displays how the gap between economic realities and professed climate strategy responds to contradictory signals from politics and markets. While European politicians stepped up expectations for radical CO 2 reduction, markets supported petroleum. Companies therefore adjusted climate-strategic visions to political pressure for legitimacy, while adapting commercial practice to profits from oil \& gas markets. Finally, our study demonstrates how policy and markets could be better realigned. For example, the EU's Green Deal, in tune with declining costs of renewables and rapidly increasing CO 2 prices, presents interesting paths towards profitable greening. Early moves from pioneering petroleum companies demonstrate that it can be done. However, greening European energy production is not enough. Climate effects will only come if consumption follows suit.},

Notwithstanding the substantial expansion of renewables in the past decade, boosted by the various policies and measures, renewable energy sources are still far from full incorporation into the energy markets. It is necessary to overcome the remaining impediments for renewables to realize the energy transition to 100\% renewable energy. The aim of this research is to analyze the main barriers of renewables and success of policies dealing with these barriers. The case studies in the Baltic States provide concrete examples of policies and their impacts in terms of overcoming barriers in relevant sectors: heating and cooling, power and transport. The assessment of policies in the Baltic States shows that there are a few measures that are implemented in the transport sector, although this sector encounters many social, economic, technological, and regulatory barriers. The countries have achieved the lowest results in approaching RES targets in transport. New financial incentives and investments in the development of infrastructure for electric vehicles are crucial for the development of markets of electric vehicles.},

In this context, we aim at analyzing the factors affecting the diffusion of local financial subsidies for NEVs in cities, to explain why some cities have taken the lead in adopting local financial subsidy policies for NEVs, while other cities have lagged behind. Based on a data set of 286 cities in China from 2009 to 2016, and with event history analysis (EHA) to analyze the strategic behaviors of local governments, we found that the number of the city's neighbors that have adopted the NEV policy, the financial incentive policy of the provincial government, the administrative ranking of the city, the city's financial situation and innovation capacity have a direct impact on whether the city adopts a local financial subsidy policy for NEVs. This study has practical implications for policymakers in designing and promoting the spread of NEV policies.},

	abstract = {As the recent withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement has shown, political volatility directly affects climate change mitigation policies, in particular in sectors, such as transport associated with long-term investments by individuals (vehicles) and by local and national governments (urban form and transport infrastructure and services). There is a large potential for cost-effective solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to improve the sustainability of the transport sector that is yet unexploited. Considering the cost-effectiveness and the potential for co-benefits, it is hard to understand why efficiency gains and CO2 emission reductions in the transport sector are still lagging behind this potential. Particularly interesting is the fact that there is substantial difference among countries with relatively similar economic performances in the development of their transport CO2 emissions over the past thirty years despite the fact that these countries had relatively similar access to efficient technologies and vehicles. This study aims to explore some well-established political science theories on the particular example of climate change mitigation in the transport sector in order to identify some of the factors that could help explain the variations in success of policies and strategies in this sector. The analysis suggests that institutional arrangements that contribute to consensus building in the political process provide a high level of political and policy stability which is vital to long-term changes in energy end-use sectors that rely on long-term investments. However, there is no direct correlation between institutional structures, e.g., corporatism and success in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector. Environmental objectives need to be built into the consensus-based policy structure before actual policy progress can be observed. This usually takes longer in consensus democracies than in politically more agile majoritarian policy environments, but the policy stability that builds on corporatist institutional structures is likely to experience changes over a longer-term, in this case to a shift towards low-carbon transport that endures.},

The state has decided to use battery storage in its grid to address these issues. This motivates us to try to understand the various business models in the state and the minimum set of barriers that must be overcome for its successful deployment. We achieve the former by assessing the projects in the state and identifying the dominant business models. For the latter, we use a barrier-solution framework that posits the minimum set of barriers that must be met for the successful deployment of battery storage business models and we verify it by identifying the role of various policies/drivers in supporting these business models. As a result, we find predominantly three business models in Hawaii: Colocated Front-of-the-Meter, Behind-the-Meter, and Aggregated Behind-the-meter. We also verify that at least one barrier from barrier categories associated with market demand and project economics along with all the barriers related to interconnection and market participation must be addressed for successful deployment of battery storage. Based on these findings, we give recommendations to policymakers seeking to develop a battery storage market.},

	abstract = {Abstract Behind-the-meter (BTM) energy storage creates benefits for a large number of stakeholders, enhancing system operation, and mitigating the increase in peak demand, as well as offering potential income from arbitraging peak/off-peak electricity tariff differentials, mitigating demand charges, and other ancillary service sources. The United States and China are among the leaders in development of energy storage, but these two countries are at different stages in terms of the storage policy landscape. The US system of federalism enables state-level policy reform, and California has been leading the country for more than a decade with policy instruments addressing BTM storage. These policy instruments include procurement targets, financial incentive plans, as well as regulatory adaptations. Under China's centralized pattern of energy governance, the deployment of new technology largely relies on signals from the national level. The first standalone national-level policy for energy storage was released in 2017, but major market barriers remain. This review draws insights from the experience of California, whose partially deregulated power market is relevant for China's ongoing market reform. In order to investigate whether the country's current market environment provides adequate opportunities for investors, this review outlines an investment analysis assessing the economics of BTM storage in China with different revenue sources. Results show that traditional revenue sources for BTM storage, namely price arbitrage and demand charge reduction, are inadequate to recover costs for investors in China. The review thus proposes policy recommendations for regulators in China aiming to further promote the deployment of BTM energy storage.

	abstract = {Vietnam experienced a solar photovoltaic (PV) installation boom in the first half of 2019, with installed capacity increasing to 4,450 MW. This saw Vietnam overtake Thailand to have the largest installed solar PV capacity in Southeast Asia. This paper investigates the underlying drivers of Vietnam's solar boom, barriers to further solar adoption, and suitable strategies for the next stage of solar adoption. Forty-six semi-structured interviews were conducted with experts from government agencies, international organizations, non-governmental organizations, universities, research institutions, and industry. A generous feed-in tariff (FIT) of US\$93.5/MWh for new projects, together with supporting policies such as tax exemptions, are found to be the key proximate drivers of Vietnam's solar PV boom. Underlying drivers include the government's desire to enhance energy self-sufficiency and the public's demand for local environmental quality. Limited transmission grid capacity and complex administrative procedures are among the key barriers. Looking forward, Vietnam has substantial potential to continue to scale up solar PV, with market-based mechanisms able to play a large role in this process. Vietnam's case is relevant for broader energy transition discussions.},

	abstract = {Low-carbon energy technologies (renewable energy and energy efficiency) are considered essential to achieve climate change mitigation goals, so a rapid deployment is needed. However there is a significant financing gap and many policymakers are concerned that investment for the large-scale deployment of low-carbon technologies will not materialise quickly enough. State investment banks (SIBs) can play a key role in closing this finance gap and leverage additional private finance. Based on 52 interviews, this paper presents empirical evidence on the role of three SIBs in addressing the barriers to financing low-carbon energy projects; the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) in Australia, the Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau (KfW) in Germany and the Green Investment Bank (GIB) in the UK. We investigate the activities and financial instruments offered by SIBs and compare these to the need for such from low-carbon developers when sourcing finance. Findings show that aside from capital provision and de-risking, SIBs take a much broader role in catalysing private investments into low-carbon investments, including enabling financial sector learning, creating trust for projects and taking a first or early mover role to help projects gain a track record.},
